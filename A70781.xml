         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT Concerning the Publication of this Work.</head>
            <p>THE Greatneſs of God hath never been more reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than in the particulars, wherein the Benefit of his Church hath been concerned. Herein he is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, that he alone diſpoſeth of all Events, which have any reſpect of tendence towards it, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning all the meaſures which humane prudence hath made for it ſelf, he permits them not to appear in the eyes of men, but cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch circumſtances, as he judges moſt proper for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and wherein they are leaſt expected.</p>
            <p>Such is the conduct he pleaſed to obſerve about this Book which we have now publiſhed. The Author took it in hand in a time which appeared of all that ever were the moſt favourable for it. The Morality of the Jeſuits then happening to be in the greateſt averſation and horrour to all them who had any light or piety. The ingenious Letters of
<hi>Montalte</hi> to the Provincial, and the learned Writings of the Parochial Rectors of <hi>Paris</hi> having diſcovered the corruption of the greater part of their Maxims; and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Prelates celebrious for their ability and piety, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cenſured them. So that it ſeemed, that the Church had no farther need in that particular, than of ſome prudent and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed perſon, who might collect together in one and the ſame Writing all the Principles of theſe corrupted Morals, and who therein might repreſent their exceſſes, to the end that thereby the reſt of its Paſtors might be animated fully to baniſh from its boſom all thoſe pernicious Novelties which disfigure the purity of its manners.</p>
            <p>This was the cauſe which moved the Author of theſe Books with an incredible care and labour to apply himſelf thereunto, having extracted out of the Books of the Jeſuits all the principal Errours which they had introduced into Chriſtian Morality, and having reduced them unto certain heads with a very neat and pure order, which may be worthy to have the name of the particular Character of his Spirit. But God permitted that when he had finiſhed this ſo important Work, he delivered it into the hands of a Doctor, one of his Friends, that he might communicate it unto others, who were of known Learning and Zeal. This Doctor acquitted himſelf faithfully in this Commiſſion: but thoſe to whom he committed <pb facs="tcp:46318:6"/>this Book, that they might examine it, being diverted therefrom, by a multitude of affairs, returned no anſwer unto him of a long time; ſo that the Author continuing ſick, ſaw himſelf nigh unto death, without knowing in a manner what was become of his Book, and only underſtood that they judged it moſt worthy to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the Church might draw therefrom very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, if it pleaſed God to give it his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>As therefore he propoſed unto himſelf in this Work no other thing than to ſerve the Church, this anſwer ſufficed to baniſh out of his mind all the diſquiet which he could have had thereabouts, and he very eaſily, and without farther trouble, did wholly commit the care of it to Divine providence, to which he had been always moſt ſubmiſſive. This ſubmiſſion notwithſtanding hindred not, but that ſome time before his death he recommended it unto another of his friends, whom he knew to be very greatly concerned, for every thing whereunto he had relation. But this Friend being not able to addreſs himſelf to any other ſave that Doctor, who had not the Book any longer in his own hands, and who could not himſelf learn thereof any news at all, ſaw himſelf ſpeedily after out of condition to ſerve both the Church and his Friend in ſuch manner as he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired.</p>
            <p>Some years paſt over in this uncertainty of what was become of this ſo precious a Work, at which time God, who had reſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf the diſpoſal thereof, cauſed it to fall happily into the hands of a perſon who had no correſpondence with its Author, but ſeeing that it might be profitable to the Church, thought himſelf obliged to contribute all his credit and power to its publication.</p>
            <p>Here you have what was thought meet for the Readers to know concerning the Hiſtory of this Book. It were to be deſired that we might ſpeak here more openly concerning its Author; but the Society of the Jeſuits have accuſtomed themſelves ſo to uſe thoſe who endeavour to ſerve them by diſcovering unto them the exceſſes wherein they engage themſelves, and ſuch is the implacable fury with which they pretend to have right according to their Maxims to perſecute them, as will not permit us to render unto his name the glory he hath therein deſerved. All that we can ſay therein, to the end we may not leave thoſe who come after us without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt ſomething of a perſon to whoſe zeal they will eſteem themſelves ſo much obliged, is only this, that he ſeemed to have been raiſed to combate and confound the Errours of theſe Fathers.</p>
            <p>He had a mind facile, clear, and ſolid; a ſweetneſs and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all reſpects charming, an humility ingenuous beyond all that can be imagined, ſtealing away the ſplendour of his other vertues from the eyes even of his moſt intimate Friends. His education was admirable, and contributed not a little to the beauty of his Spirit, the purity of his Learning, and the innocence of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For he was born of a Father who had a care altogether pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him to fortifie happily his Children againſt popular Errours, to inſpire into them the moſt pure Maxims of the Goſpel, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their minds with the faireſt ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46318:6"/>This ſo ſage and ſo Chriſtian conduct helped very much to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the inclination which he had unto piety; ſo that he had no ſooner finiſhed his courſe in Philoſophy than he proceeded of himſelf to the ſtudy of Divinity, to which he applyed himſelf with ſo great ſucceſs, that being received into the Colledge and Society of
<hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> he performed all his acts with univerſal applauſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon received there the Doctors Cap.</p>
            <p>The only thing he had to combate with in this his laudable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, was the paſſionate affection which he had for the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. For as this Science is the moſt aſſured of all humane Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and almoſt the only one in which may be found any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty capable to ſatisfie a Spirit which loves the truth; the love which he had even to this truth it ſelf, wrought in him ſo violent an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to this Science, that he could not withhold himſelf from applying and buſying his thoughts therein for the inventing ſome or other new machine. But at length the Holy Spirit, which did conduct his Studies, made him overcome in a little time the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion he had to theſe innocent inquiries and curioſities, and he thought that it was not ſufficient for a Divine to deſpiſe the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements of the world, but that he ought alſo to deprive himſelf of thoſe of his mind, and he did only ſearch after the truth where it was to be found, that is to ſay, in the Holy Scripture and in the Books of the holy Fathers. So that we may well ſay of him what S.
<hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> ſaid in commendations of his Brother
<hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius,</hi> who had greatly loved Aſtrology and the Mathematicks, that he had the ingenuity to draw out of theſe ſorts of Sciences all that was profitable therein, learning thence to admire the inviſible greatneſſes of God, which were reſplendent in his works, and knew to defend himſelf from that which was pernicious in them, which is the adherence they have, who apply themſelves thereunto, to their conjectures and to thoſe truths which they pretend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover therein.</p>
            <p>This generous diſengaging himſelf from all other things, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged him not a little in the progreſs which he made in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge, and in that part of Divinity which they call Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick, which conducts Reaſon by the light of Faith and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This his progreſs appeared more eſpecially in the troubles which agitated the Faculty of Divinity of <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 1656. for he there defended the truth with ſo great moderation, that he did not render it odious, but on the contrary he did aſtoniſh and ſurprize his enemies.</p>
            <p>The zeal he had for it was ardent, but this ardour was tempered by his prudence: and his knowledge was not leſs modeſt than his ſweetneſs was couragious, that there might be ſeen equally light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his diſcourſe, the regard which he had not to diſoblige any perſon, and the inflexible firmity which God had given him for the defence of his truth.</p>
            <p>The wounds which that renowned Body received then in its Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, entred very deep into his heart; and the grief which he received therefrom, increaſed by the conſideration of the miſchiefs <pb facs="tcp:46318:7"/>which the Church was threatned with, and which it reſents unto this day, began to alter his health, and to indiſpoſe him towards that ſickneſs whereof he dyed.</p>
            <p>But nothing touched him more to the quick than the corruption which the Jeſuits had introduced into the Morality of the Church. He was a mortal enemy to their compliances, and he could not bear with their preſumption which bent them to conſult no other in their Divinity than their own proper light. He declared againſt their looſneſs in all the Eccleſiaſtick Conferences whereunto he was invited, and he gave himſelf up particularly in the Sermons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which he made in the Churches, to fortifie the Faithful againſt their pernicious Maxims.</p>
            <p>His Diſcourſes made ſo much deeper impreſſion upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, becauſe they were ſuſtained by his own examples, and the truths of Chriſtianity were no leſs viſible in his manners, than they were intelligible in his words. He handled all ſorts of matters with ſuch exactneſs and ſolidity, as if he had employed all his life only in ſtudy of ſome one of them alone; and it might be perceived that he ſtudied in all his Diſcourſes only to clear the underſtanding, to touch hearts, and heal diſeaſes; and not to puzzle the mind, pleaſe the ears, and flatter the diſeaſed.</p>
            <p>But the love which he had for the purity of Chriſtian Morals was too great for to ſuffer him to reſt ſo contented. He believed that to heal well the miſchiefs which the Jeſuits had done the Church, it was neceſſary to have a perfect knowledge thereof, and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Phyſitians who addict themſelves to know the bottom of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before they apply themſelves to any remedy. He gave himſelf for this cauſe to read the Books of theſe Fathers, and to extract out of them the principal Errours, of which he hath compoſed this Book which we now publiſh, but at length he could not but ſink under ſo painful and afflicting a labour. His patience found it ſelf exhauſted. The grief he had to ſee the Morality of Jeſus Chriſt ſo horribly disfigured, ſeized his heart, and caſt him into ſuch a languor as dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up by little and little, and raviſhed him away from the Church, after he had received with great reſentments of Piety and Religion all the Sacraments at the hands of his upper Paſtor.</p>
            <p>I will not take in hand to give here an Idea of the deſign which this excellent Man hath had in this Work, of the order which he hath obſerved, of the reaſons which he hath had to undertake it, and of thoſe in particular which have engaged him to cope with the Doctrine of the Jeſuits, becauſe he hath himſelf given ſatisfaction in all theſe points in his Preface.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only anſwer here to thoſe who have wiſhed that he had not diſcovered the Errours which are repreſented in this Work, without refuting them by the true Principles of Chriſtian Morality, which are Scripture and Tradition. They avow that this had been advantagious to the Church; and it was the very deſign of the Author. But this hinders not but that his labour, although ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the more large Refutation, may have alſo its utility. For they who are acquainted with the Affairs of the Church, underſtand <pb facs="tcp:46318:7"/>that it is no new thing ſimply to ſet down the Errours which the Corrupters of Faith and Manners have attempted to introduce into the Church, without undertaking to combate them by long Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and that S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (as alſo S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved)
<note place="margin">Hiſtorics narratione commemorans omnia, nulla diſputatione adverſus falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem pro veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate decertans, <hi>S. Auguſt. de Hareſ.</hi>
               </note> hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented by way of Hiſtory the pernicious Opinions of the greater part of Hereticks, without taking in hand to refute them in particular; rehearſing all things with an Hiſtorical Narration, but not contending for the truth againſt falſhood by any diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>I know well that there is cauſe to believe, by that which S.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> adds preſently after, that he had only an Abridgment of the Books of S. <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> But I know alſo, that if this Saint had ſeen them all entire, he would ſtill have diſcourſed after the ſame manner, and that this Judgment may very juſtly be paſſed on them; for that of eighty different Sects, of which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> hath undertaken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Errours, he only tracks the foot, as I may ſay, of them one by one, and refutes in the manner of a Divine only four or five, contenting himſelf in a few words, and as it were on his way paſſing by them, to ſhew the abſurdity of the Conceits of thoſe Hereticks, and how far they were diſtanced from the truth. See how he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets himſelf in his Preface concerning the manner in which he had deſigned to handle theſe things: <hi>In which truly this one thing we ſhall perform, that we ſhall oppoſe againſt them as much as in us lies, in a few words, as it were an Antidote, whereby we may expel their poyſons, and by Gods help may free any one who either wilfully or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares happens to fall into theſe Heretical opinions, as it were into the poyſon of ſome Serpents.</hi>

            <p>This is the ſame thing which the Author of this Book of Morals, which is now made publick, hath given us to ſee therein with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous addreſs and vivacity of Spirit. For though he undertake not to refute theſe Errours of the Jeſuits, but only to diſcover them, he does notwithſtanding diſcover them without making their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to appear moſt plainly, and the oppoſition alſo which they have to the truth and ſound doctrine. So that according to the progreſs by which we advance in reading this Book, we find our ſelves inſenſibly convinced of the falſities of all the Maxims which are therein related; and our minds filled with the oppoſite truths; and our hearts piouſly animated againſt theſe ſo horrible corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and edified by the violence which we obſerve this Author hath done upon himſelf for to moderate his zeal, and to keep himſelf back from refuting opinions ſo contrary to the common ſenſe of the Faith.
<hi>For unto ſuch evils deep ſighs and groans are more agreeable than long diſcourſes.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Indeed the arguings of the Jeſuits which he relates, and whereof they make uſe to authorize their monſtrous opinions, are ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contrary to the Principles and Maxims of the Goſpel, and to the light of Nature; the abuſe to which they put the words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and the Fathers, is ſo viſible and ſo groſs, and there needs ſo little diſcerning to ſee that they take them in a ſenſe contrary to what they do indeed contain, that theſe Authors deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <pb facs="tcp:46318:8"/>and are refuted themſelves by themſelves, and it ſuffices ſimply to report their Doctrine, to make appear that it overturns the Foundations of Religion, and that it is not only oppoſite to the Wiſdom of the Croſs and Chriſtian Philoſophy, but alſo to Reaſon and the Philoſophy of the Heathens.</p>
            <p>It is true that this corruption is not equally evident in all their Maxims, and that to ſurprize more eaſily thoſe who have ſome fear of God, they do propoſe theſe unto them with ſome kind of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, covering them with ſome ſpecious pretences, which ſerve for reaſons to engage them to follow them without ſcruple. But the Author of theſe Morals hath ſo dextrouſly unfolded all theſe Artifices, and all theſe ſtudied ſubtilties, and hath ſo neatly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their malignity, that there is no fear that thoſe who read them will ſuffer themſelves to be deceived by them, nor that they can have any confidence in the people, whom he hath made clearly to appear to have a priviledge to ſpeak every thing that they pleaſe, and not to contradict themſelves at all in ſpeaking things altogether contrary, according to the diverſity of places, times, and the intereſt of their Society; who give themſelves the liberty and the right, not only of two contrary opinions, to chuſe that which is moſt for their commodity, but even to follow both the two according to divers occaſions, and the different reliſhes of thoſe who conſult with them; finally, who content not themſelves only to refute the holy Fathers, the Popes, and the Councils, when they are not for their convenience, but who alſo take the confidence to make them ſpeak what they pleaſe, altogether contrary to what they do ſpeak.</p>
            <p>It is true alſo, that this Author having undertaken to make us ſee the general corruption which the Jeſuits have ſpread all over the Morals, could not avoid to ſpeak of thoſe matters, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith ought not to be proceeded in ſo far as to be named by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and that he is forced to ſhew how they would make Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which is the Image of all pure and all holy Union of Jeſus Chriſt with the Church, and which ought to be handled with all honour, to give right to ſhameful filthineſſes, which even the Pagan Philoſophers themſelves have condemned, according to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent words of an ancient Author:
<hi>Adulter eſtuxoris amator acrior. He is an Adulterer who is too eager a Lover of his Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding he hath been careful not to tranſcribe thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, with which <hi>Sanchez</hi> hath filled whole Volumes, among which ſome have been ſo ſcandalous, that they have been left out in ſome Editions, which yet have been no hinderance to <hi>Tambourin</hi> and
<hi>Amadeus</hi> to renew them; where he ſpeaks of theſe exceſſes and other ſuch like, it is with ſuch temperance, that diſcharging the Reader of a good part of the confuſion which he might have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereby, he doth not forbear at all to inſtruct him ſufficiently, and make him conceive all that horrour wherein he ought to have theſe miſerable Writers, who ſeem principally to be compoſed to ſatiate their imagination with moſt enormous unheard of crimes.</p>
            <p>Finally, That which doth yet more juſtifie the deſign of the Author of theſe Morals, and the manner wherein he handles theſe <pb facs="tcp:46318:8"/>things, is that now of a long time all theſe exceſſes which are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in rehearſed, have been made publick by the Jeſuits themſelves, who have cauſed them to be printed and ſold, and who have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them into the hands of an infinite of Religious perſons and Directors of others not very clear ſighted, who think that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better learn the Maxims of Chriſtian Morality than in reading the moſt famous Authors of ſo celebrated a Society. So that it will be of very great importance to make the corruptions of theſe Authors ſo known, that no man may hereafter be miſtaken in them. And this cannot be better executed than by propoſing thoſe very ſame Maxims as impious and deteſtable, which the Jeſuits have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in their Books as good and ſafe; this alone being ſufficient to work effects altogether contrary in mens ſpirits, as may be ſeen in the Example of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> who having been imprinted thirty nine times, as a very good Book, hath been now imprinted the fortieth time, as one of the moſt miſchievous Books in the whole World; which hath ſo wrought, that whereas the firſt thirty nine Editions were very prejudicial to the Church, this fortieth hath been very beneficial unto it.</p>
            <p>And the ſame we believe may happen in the publication of theſe Morals, which the alone zeal and love of the purity of the Morality of Jeſus Chriſt hath induced us to make publick. It is hoped that this Publication will prevail to remove the ſcandal which the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits have cauſed from the Church, to which they gave place to the Hereticks to attribute thoſe Opinions for which it hath the greateſt horrour; and that theſe unhappy perſons who are ſeparated from its communion, ſhall not impute them unto it any more, after ſo publick a diſavowing of theſe Maxims altogether abominable as they are; not giving them yet any advantage above the Jeſuits themſelves, becauſe it is not hard to make appear that the Principles of their Morality are no leſs corrupted nor pernicious than thoſe of theſe Fathers.</p>
            <p>It is hoped that this Publication will ſtir up the Paſtors of the Church to renew the zeal which they have already made appear againſt the Authors of ſo many corruptions; that they will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in their Dioceſſes the reading of theſe Books; that they will take the ways which the Sacred Canons have preſcribed them, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17.) to repreſs ſo pernicious Novelties, and that they will hinder them that they ſpread not over mens ſpirits, as Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenes which waſte and corrupt by little and little that which was ſound; and that they will fear, leſt while they diſſemble theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and paſs by thoſe who are their Authors, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves culpable of the loſs of a great number of Souls, which theſe blind Guides ſeduce and train along with them into the pit.</p>
            <p>We deſpair not even of the Jeſuits themſelves, that they alſo may draw from thence the advantage which this Author hath earneſtly deſired to procure them. For although it ſeems by their conduct, which they have hitherto held herein, that they are reſolved to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in maintaining theſe damnable Maxims, and to deſpiſe the wholeſom advertiſements which the whole Church hath given them, <pb facs="tcp:46318:9"/>to abandon them; yet notwithſtanding it may be ſaid, that if they have uſed them in this ſort, it hath been perhaps, becauſe they were not yet ſufficiently convinced of the juſtice of the reproaches which have been caſt on them, and that ſome ſecret intereſt hath hindred them from perceiving them in the Writings of thoſe whom they looked upon as their Adverſaries. But now that a perſon whom they cannot ſuſpect, and who hath never been engaged againſt them, hath preſented unto them ſo diſtinctly the concatenation of the Maxims and Concluſions which their Authors have taught, it will be very hard for them not to be ſurprized therein, and not to be powerfully ſtruck by ſo many deteſtable Opinions. Who knows but God, hearing the prayers, which have now for a long time been ordained by the whole Clergy of
<hi>France,</hi> and which have been made publickly in ſome particular Dioceſſes, to beg for them, that he would open their eyes, may touch them and bring them on highly to diſowne the Authors of ſo many abominations, and to make it appear by their condemning them themſelves as publick Plagues and declared Enemies of all Truth and Juſtice, that the Crimes with which they have been reproached belong on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſome private men, and not to the whole Society.</p>
            <p>The approbation of the Doctors hath not been ſought after for the Publication of this Book. For beſides that there was no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent need to expoſe the Approbators to the indignation of a Society, who hold it for a Maxime, that they may with a ſafe conſcience kill them who pretend to hurt them in their reputations, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that this precaution would not be neceſſary on this occaſion. Indeed the Author producing nothing of his own in this Book, and having preſcribed unto himſelf only therein to repreſent faithfully thoſe Maxims alone of the Jeſuits Morals which are notoriouſly wicked, and which are the very ſame againſt which all the Parochial Rectors of the moſt conſiderable Towns of the Realm have been ſtirred up; ſo that the Pope, the Biſhops, the Sorbonne, and the other Catholick Faculties have condemned by their Cenſures the Apology of the Caſuiſts; and that the Faculty of Divinity in <hi>Paris</hi> have now very lately cenſured in the Books of <hi>Vernant</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus,</hi> we believe all theſe Cenſures to be as ſo many Approbations of this Book, and that for that cauſe the Pope, the Biſhops, the Sorbonne, and the other Faculties, and the Parochial Rectors of the principal Towns of <hi>France</hi> may paſs for its Approbators, or at leaſt of the Doctrine contained therein. For as to the knowing whether the Author hath been a faithful Relator of the Propoſitions of the Authors whom he cites every one in particular, may well be allowed to judge thereof, becauſe indeed better Judges of this ſort of differences than the eyes of thoſe who ſhall have any ſcruple in this point, cannot be had.</p>
            <p>But if the Jeſuits and ſome of the Partiſans of their Society com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of this Author, becauſe he hath ſo exactly repreſented their Extravagances, there is cauſe to hope that all other faithful people will be ſatisfied therewith, becauſe that one may ſay in truth that he gives by his Book unto every one that which belongs unto him, <pb facs="tcp:46318:9"/>and which the Caſuiſts of the Society have uſed their utmoſt force to raviſh from them. He gives unto God the love, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and the worſhip which belongs unto him; to the Church the belief and ſubmiſſion of the Faithful; to worldly Powers their honour and the fidelity of their Subjects, ſafety to their Eſtates; to Fathers and Mothers the obedience and reſpect of their Children; to Children the love and tenderneſs of their Fathers and Mothers; Conjugal fidelity to Husbands and Wives; to Maſters the fidelity of their Servants; to Servants kindneſs of their Maſters; to the Eccleſiaſticks Piety and Religion; equity and integrity to Judges; true honour unto the Nobility; fair dealing unto Merchants. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he eſtabliſhes in the World all thoſe Vertues which the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits ſeem reſolved to baniſh from thence, that they might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and cauſe to reign there all the diſorders which the malice of men or the Devil himſelf was capable to invent.</p>

               <head>The Deſign and Order of this Work.</head>
               <p>THE end of Morality, not only among Chriſtians, but alſo among the Pagans, hath always been to make known that which is good, and to ſeparate it from the bad; to carry men on to vertue and to good actions, and to turn them away from vice and from ſin; and in purſuit thereof to teach them the means to proceed from the one to the other. It cannot be ſhewed, more eaſily and more evidently, how dangerous and prejudicial the Moral Divinity of the Jeſuits is, than by making it appear that it tends and leads to a quite contrary end; and that it walks in ways oppoſite to Reaſon and to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as thoſe of Chriſtian Piety; that it confounds good and evil, or to uſe the words of Scripture, it calls evil good, and good evil; that the more part of the reſolutions which it gives upon the points and particular caſes which reſpect conſcience, tend to the ſtopping up in men the lights and motions of conſcience it ſelf, and favours luſt which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts it; that the Principles from which they draw their Reſolutions, and the Reaſons of which they make uſe for to ſupport them, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means and expedients proper for to authorize vice, to ſuſtain ſin, to excuſe the moſt criminal actions, and to entertain looſneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in all ſorts of Profeſſions.</p>
               <p>This is that which I have a deſign to make appear in this Book. And to the end that I may before-hand give a general Idea of all that which I handle therein, and repreſent moſt clearly the Method and conſequence of the means whereof I make uſe to juſtifie that which I pretend, I will expoſe here in a few words the whole order and diſpoſition of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>I reduce all theſe matters to certain principal Points, which I handle after ſuch manner and in ſuch order as ſeems to me moſt clear and moſt proper to make appear the conſequence of the Moral Doctrine of the Jeſuits, the connexion of their Principles with their Concluſions, and the conformity of their practice with their Opinions. For the conſort and the reſemblance which is between their Doctrine and their Conduct is ſo perfect, that it is viſible it proceeds from the ſame Spirit, tends to the ſame end, which is to pleaſe men, to ſatisfie them by flattering their paſſions and their intereſts, and to train them up in vice and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
               <p>To ſee clearly the truth of this point, which is the whole ſubject of this Book, it muſt firſt be conſidered that there ſeems not poſſible to be found a way more proper to authorize vice and ſin, than to approve and tolerate all that which nouriſhes them, and to aboliſh all that which is oppoſite to them, and may deſtroy them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the things which beget and nouriſh vice and ſin, are partly <pb facs="tcp:46318:10"/>within man, as corrupt ſeeds from whence proceed all the evil which he commits; and partly without man, as outward objects, which beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his ſenſes and his mind, carry his will to conſent unto evil and ſin, which abides and acts inceſſantly within him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the things which are within man, as the corrupt fountain from whence comes all the diſorders and ſins which he commits, are luſt, ignorance, and evil habits, and hypocriſie, or the ſecret malice of the heart covered with a veil of good intention; and that the outward things which carry him on unto evil are the occaſions of ſin, the objects which draw on the evil examples, the evil cuſtoms which excite them and nouriſh them; and above all, humane Authority and humane Reaſon corrupted by ſin, which furniſheth Inventions for continuance in evil, and in the occaſions of evil wherein he is engaged, and to juſtifie or excuſe the moſt criminal actions by imaginary probabilities.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the things which deſtroy or expel ſin are likewiſe of two ſorts, ſome as if it were internal, and others external. I call thoſe internal which attract to and eſtabliſh in the heart of man the Grace of God, by which ſin is deſtroyed, ſuch as are Faith, Prayer, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, good Works, and a right uſe of the Sacraments. I call theſe external, which do from without repreſent ſin unto a man, whether it be by the knowledge which they give him of its malice, of the hatred which God bears towards it, of the puniſhments which he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it in the other life, and thoſe with which he puniſheth it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even in this very life; or which in any other like manner may give him an averſion from it, and hinder him from committing it; as are the Commandments of God, thoſe of the Church, and generally all the holy Scriptures old and new, which contain all the Promiſes which God hath made to good men, and all the evils with which he doth threaten ſinners.</p>
               <p>There is no perſon, I am confident, who will not eaſily agree to theſe Truths and general Principles. So that I have nothing to do, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to the particular Subject which I handle, to acquit my ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of what I have undertaken to prove, to wit, that the Divinity of the Jeſuits is as favourable to vice and ſin as poſſibly it can be. It ſuffices me for this purpoſe to make appear that it nouriſhes luſt, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, evil habits, and the corruption of the will, covered with a veil and pretence of a good intention.</p>
               <p>That it entertains men in occaſions of ſin, in evil cuſtoms, in licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and abuſes, as well publick and common to all, as peculiar to every Profeſſion, making uſe of humane and corrupt Reaſon for authorizing theſe diſorders, and to make them paſs as good and indifferent, and gives for a Rule of Chriſtian life and the Foundation of eternal life, not Faith and the Word of God, but the Authority of Men, and all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and thoughts which preſent themſelves unto their minds, provided they can render them probable, and give them ſome colour and appearance of truth.</p>
               <p>That it aboliſheth or corrupts Repentance, Prayers, good Works, the Sacraments, the Commands of God, of the Church, and the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>That finally it introduceth and confirmeth corruption and looſneſs in <pb facs="tcp:46318:11"/>all ſorts of Profeſſions Seculars and Eccleſiaſticks, attempting to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and excuſe thoſe vices and ſins which are moſt oppoſite thereto, and which are to them for all that moſt common, as injuſtice in the Courts, unfaithfulneſs in Traffick, and other ſuch like.</p>
               <p>If I can juſtifie all theſe things, I have all my deſign accompliſhed, and I ſhall have ſhewed that the Jeſuits Divinity favours and nouriſhes vice and ſin as much as men can do, and that they ſeem to be become thereof the Advocates and Profeſſors.</p>
               <p>Which I hope to do in this Writing with ſo much clearneſs, that no perſon ſhalt be thereof unconvinced, and with ſuch perfect fidelity, that thoſe who are the leaſt equitable, becauſe they are too ſcrupulous or too paſſionate, ſhall have nothing to reproach me with on this Subject. For I will do nothing elſe but report ſimply the Opinions of the Authors Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits as they have expreſſed themſelves in their Books. I will frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add their proper Reaſons, and in the more important Points I ſhall ſometimes aſcend to the Principles from whence they draw their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
               <p>I undertake not to refute their Errours, but only to diſcover them, and make them appear. This is the cauſe why without engaging my ſelf to produce the places of holy Scripture or of Tradition, any more than the Reaſons which may be alledged to refel them, I content my ſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and repreſent them in ſuch ſort, that they may be underſtood what they are; and many times I content my ſelf to reherſe them as they themſelves expreſs them, when that is ſufficient to raiſe an horrour againſt them. When the malice is more concealed, I endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, and to make it evident by ſome Reflections or ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or by Examples and ſenſible Compariſons: and if I make uſe of any Reaſons, I take them in a manner always from themſelves, or from Principles of Faith and natural Light, which are altogether indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo evident, that to oppoſe them, were to renounce common ſenſe, as well as Chriſtian Piety and Religion.</p>
               <p>I meddle not here with matters of Faith, nor Myſteries of Religion, where it was as eaſie to make appear that the Jeſuits are no leſs tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported than in the Maxims of Morality, as will appear clearly by one Example out of the Chapter <hi>(of Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> which I thought ſhould be added to that <hi>of Grace.</hi> There may be ſeen in what manner they ſpeak of the Son of God, of his Incarnation, of his Humanity, of his Divine Perſon, and that they have thereof thoughts ſo baſe, ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſo ſhameful, that they are not more proper for any end than to expoſe our Myſteries to the ſcorn and contempt of Infidels and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and to raiſe horrour and averſation in the Faithful themſelves by their impious expreſſions and reaſonings, by which they profane Holineſs it ſelf, and deſtroy the reſpect and veneration which ought to be given it.</p>
               <p>I inſiſt upon Moral matters only, and even without deſign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them all. I ſhould need many Volumes only to make an Extract of that which may be found in their Books contrary to good Manners and to Chriſtian Piety. I intend only to collect ſome principal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions by which Judgment may be made of the reſt. I report them ſimply as they are in their Books. And when I tranſlate them, I will <pb facs="tcp:46318:11"/>ſet the paſſages on the Margent in Latine, to the end that the fidelity and ſincerity with which I recite them may appear.</p>
               <p>If amongst many paſſages which I commonly produce on the ſame Subject, there be ſome which appear not clear enough, there may be found in others that which ſeems to be wanting in them. But I have reaſon to believe that there is no cauſe to reproach me herein, for I have taken a particular care not only to ſpeak things, ſo as I underſtood them, but alſo to enter as far as I could into the very thoughts of the Fathers whom I have alledged, knowing that it is never lawful to wound Juſtice or Charity under a pretence of combating Errour, and defending Truth, and that Errour it ſelf may not be aſſailed, nor Truth defended by lying and diſguiſement.</p>
               <p>I am ſo far from deſiring to augment this evil, or to exaggerate theſe things, that I oftentimes abſtain from ſpeaking as I could without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from my deſign. They that have any love or knowledge of the Truth, will eaſily perceive this my moderation, and they will oftentimes find nothing elſe to reprove me for in many important points, but that I have not ſpoken enough therein, and that I give over many times where they would cry out to me that I ought to go on, and follow my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the utmoſt.</p>
               <p>If there be any who find herein expreſſions which ſeem to them to be too vehement, and far removed from that ſweetneſs and moderation which they love; I beſeech them not to judge according to their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but according to the things whereof I ſpeak. The paſſion or the praeoccupation they may be under, either for the pernicious Maxims which I repreſent, or for the Authors, or for the Defenders of them, may be capable to perſwade them that I ought to have ſpoken of them with ſo much reſpect and moderation, as belongs to the moſt ſerious and holy things. But the reaſon and the nature even of the things themſelves may eaſily undeceive them, if they conſider that expreſſions ought to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with their ſubjects, and that it would introduce a diſproportion to repreſent thoſe things which are ridiculous and contemptible as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly as if they were not, and that this were to give too much advantage to preſumption and inſolence, which ſpeaks proudly to make Errour tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Truth, and to give it in ſome ſort the victory, to treat it otherwiſe than with ſuch force and vigour as is capable to repreſs and humble it.</p>
               <p>So it is that Truth would be defended, and hath it ſelf declared that it will one day revenge it ſelf on them that have aſſailed it with ſcorn and obſtinacy, not only bruiſing their heads, but alſo inſulting over them, that they may be covered with confuſion.</p>
               <p>So that I have ſome cauſe to fear in this point on the behalf of Truth, that I have been rather too reſerved than too free. And it ſeems that they who have any love for it, may complain of me, that I have not defended it with force and ardour enough in an encounter where it hath been aſſaulted by a very extraordinary Conſpiracy of perſons who for their own intereſt, ſufficiently well known, have endeavoured to blot out of the memory of the Faithful, and Books of the Church the moſt pure and ſafe Maxims concerning the Regulation and Conduct of Chriſtian life and Manners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46318:12"/>And I may perhaps have ſome trouble to defend my ſelf from this reproach, and to hinder that it be not believed, That I have not defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cauſe of the Church and of Truth with the zeal which they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but that I have already declared that I have not at all undertaken properly to defend it, or refute thoſe who have aſſailed and hurt it ſo cruelly; but to make appear only the Errours and the pernicious Maxims by which they have overturned all Diſcipline and all the Rules of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Chriſtian life, even the moſt holy and beſt eſtabliſhed upon the Scriptures and Books of the Saints, and alſo by their Examples.</p>
               <p>Hereunto I have limited and obliged my ſelf in this Work. It may be God will raiſe up ſome other who ſhall go on where I leave, and will undertake to refute fully the Errours which I have diſcovered, and to eſtabliſh by the Principles of Faith and Tradition the Truths which I have only noted in my paſſage. The manner in which this firſt Book ſhall be received, and the profit which will come thereon, may procure a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to receive alſo yet better another of greater importance, and be a motive to engage God to ſtir up ſome other perſon to labour therein. We are all in his hands, our travels and our thoughts, whereof the firſt and principal ought to be never in any thing to have other than his deſigns. He knows that which he hath given me in this Work, is no other than to perform ſome Service to his Church and my Neighbour. I beſeech him to bleſs it with ſucceſs, leaving it to his Providence to diſpoſe of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſhall pleaſe, and I do for the preſent accept with all reſpect and ſubmiſſion whatſoever he ſhall ordain thereof.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>The Neceſſity and Utility of this Work.</head>
               <p>IF the pernicious Maxims of the Jeſuits Morality ſhould for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be preſented no otherwiſe than in an extract, without adding any thing thereto but what is found in their Authors, the World is at this day ſo indifferent in things which reſpect their Salvation and Religion, there would be found very few perſons who would be touched therewith, or who would take any pains to conſider them.</p>
               <p>But it is come to paſs by the particular order of Divine Providence, that he who hath enterpriſed to diſcover them ſome years ago, hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt them in a manner ſo taking, that hath attracted the whole World unto him to read them by the grace of his ſtyle, and thereupon hath made them eaſily to appear odious and inſupportable by their proper exceſſes and extravagancies.</p>
               <p>This ſo happy beginning had hath ſucceſs much more happy; for mens minds being touched with a deſire to know particularly things ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and ſo prejudicial to their Conſciences and Salvation, my Maſters the Parochial Rectors of <hi>Rouen</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> have in purſuit thereof pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with a zeal worthy of their Charge many learned Writings, which have given to all the World enough of inſtruction and light to conceive the diſtance and horrour they ought to keep towards that wicked Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the danger whereinto they put them who follow theſe Guides who purſue or practiſe them.</p>
               <p>But as their deſign was only to make a ſpeedy order againſt an evil which then did but begin to appear, they believed that it was ſufficient <pb facs="tcp:46318:12"/>to adviſe their people thereof in general terms, in notifying unto them ſome of the more pernicious propoſitions, without extending them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſcover their principles, conſequences, and unhappy effects, as it had been eaſie for them to do; and they thought that to ſtrangle them in their birth, it would have been ſufficient only to expoſe them to the view of the whole World, being in themſelves ſo odious and monſtrous, and to oppoſe themſelves to thoſe that teach them, as the Shepherds obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to reſiſt the Wolves who would devour their ſtock. Yet they omitted not to have recourſe to the Authority of the Church, and to addreſs their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and requeſts to my Lords the Biſhops and to the General Aſſembly of the Clergie of <hi>France,</hi> in the year 1656. who ſeeing that it was not at all in their power at that time to do them juſtice, did at leaſt make it known to the whole Church, that opportunity only was wanting unto them. And for that cauſe ordained that the Inſtructions of S. <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould be imprinted by the order of the Clergie, with a circular Letter to all my Lords the Prelates, which ſerved to prejudge their opinions, and to give as it were a commencement to the condemnation of all theſe Maxims in general, expecting till ſome opportunity were offered to do it more ſolemnly.</p>
               <p>The voice of theſe charitable Paſtors was heard and faithfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by their ſheep, who by the ſubmiſſion they owed to them, and through the confidence which they had in their honeſty and ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, entred into an averſion againſt this new Doctrine, as ſoon as it was declared unto them, that it was contrary to the Doctrine of the Church and that of the holy Fathers.</p>
               <p>It were alſo to be wiſhed, that this ſame voice which came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, being Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks in the Church by its Paſtors, had turned, or at leaſtwiſe ſtayed the Authors of this Doctrine, and had kept them in ſilence, and that they had themſelves alſo ſuppreſſed theſe ſtrange opinions and pernicious Maxims, againſt which they ſaw the whole World to riſe with a general indignation, and with a moſt juſt zeal.</p>
               <p>But this did nothing but provoke them yet more, ſo that inſtead of receiving Chriſtian-like the charitable correction of theſe worthy Paſtors of Souls, they had the confidence to appear in publick to maintain ſo great Errours by Writings yet more wicked; imitating thoſe fierce beaſts, who iſſue in fury out of the Foreſts and Dens to defend their young when they are about to be taken from them.</p>
               <p>My Maſters the Parochial Rectors had by an extraordinary tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and moderation ſuppreſſed the names of the Jeſuits, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed them from the other Caſuiſts, attacquing the Doctrine only without touching the perſons of any particular Order. But theſe good Fathers could neither lye hid; nor keep ſilence, and judged themſelves unworthy of the favour which they had received upon this occaſion. And as if this Doctrine had been their own particularly, they would needs declare themſelves the Defenders of it, as indeed they are the principal and even the firſt Authors thereof in many of its moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant points. They made for it an Apologie, wherein ſo very far were they from diſavowing and retracting thoſe pernicious Maxims where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were reproached, that they did highly maintain them: and to teſtifie that they never intended to recant them, they have declared <pb facs="tcp:46318:13"/>that in many matters wherein their exceſſes are moſt viſible, they can yet ſpeak more, and give yet more licence to their ſpirits.</p>
               <p>An evil ſo publick and ſo obſtinate cannot be healed nor ſtayed by ſimple words. Which thing hath obliged my Maſters the Parochial Rectors, to renew their complaints and their inſtances to my Lords the Prelates.</p>
               <p>Some of them have already worthily acquitted themſelves in this their duty to the Church and People who depend on their charge. And it is hoped that the zeal and charity of the reſt will preſs them to give the ſame teſtimony unto the truth, and that if ſome of them, for ſome particular reaſons, cannot do it ſo ſolemnly as they deſire, yet they will not ceaſe to condemn in their hearts, and upon occaſions which ſhall be offered, this novel Doctrine, and to keep thoſe whom they can at a diſtance from it, as a moſt pernicious Divinity.</p>
               <p>After all this, it was thought to be high time farther to diſcover this Doctrine, and to repreſent it in the whole extent it hath in the Books of the Jeſuits, that the corruption and the venom of it might be better known. It had been to little purpoſe to have done it ſooner, becauſe that the exceſs and overthrow it hath given to all the true Rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Chriſtian piety, are ſo great and ſo incredible, that the world having yet never heard any thing like unto it, would have been ſurprized at the novelty and impiety of the principal Maxims of theſe dreadful Morals: ſo that many would have been troubled to believe it; others would have been offended at it; and many would have altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglected it, and would not ſo much as have taken the pains only to have informed themſelves ſo far as that they might not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſurprized therein.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits themſelves would not have failed to have broken out into complaints, calumnies, and impoſtures, which are common with them in uſe againſt ſuch as diſcover their ſecrets, and the ſhame of their Divinity: and they would have employed all their artifices and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes to elude or obſcure the moſt clear things wherewith they ſhould have been reproached, though they had been repreſented ſimply as they are expreſſed in their Books.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding that theſe pernicious Maxims had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and decryed by my Maſters the Parochial Rectors, fulminated by the cenſures of the Biſhops, there is cauſe to hope that expoſing them to the day will be uſeful to many of the Faithful, and hereby will be ſeen more clearly the juſtice and neceſſity of the purſuits which the Parochial Rectors made for obtaining a cenſure of them, the equity of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prelates made in purſuance thereof, and the obligation which all the Faithful have upon them to ſtiffle theſe Monſters of Errour and Impiety, which multiply continually, and prey upon the Church. So that this will even contribute very much to redouble the ſubmiſſion and confidence which they ought to have towards their Paſtors, ſeeing from what miſchiefs their vigilance and their zeal hath preſerved them, and with what prudence and wiſdom they have conducted them in this affair, having not diſcovered the greatneſs of the evil to them before, as it may be ſaid, they had delivered them from it.</p>
               <p>And it may alſo come to paſs, that the Authors and Defenders of theſe <pb facs="tcp:46318:13"/>wicked Doctrines may themſelves be ſurprized and have horrour, when they ſee together in a ſequence of Principles and Concluſions the opinions which they have maintained to this preſent. Becauſe it is very common for things good or evil, which apart make no great impreſſion upon the ſpirit, ſurprize and touch it powerfully when as they are united and joyned together.</p>
               <p>There is alſo cauſe to believe that many of thoſe who have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto this preſent theſe novel Maxims of the Jeſuits, only becauſe they did not perceive all the unhappy conſequences and pernicious effects of them, now coming to know them, as this Book will give them means to do, will relinquiſh them with joy, and thoſe who ſhall adhere to them, through paſſion or intereſt may be brought to teſtifie the horrour they have conceived againſt them, by the renunciation which they ſhall make of them, or at leaſt by the ſilence they ſhall keep, and wherein they ſhall bury them, ſo as neither to hold nor teach them any more for the future.</p>
               <p>But if they ſhall not draw hence the fruit which is deſired, and they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt both the one and the other to maintain the ſame Maxims, they teſtifie openly hereby, that they alſo admit all the conſequences, whereof they cannot be ignorant any longer. And by conſequence they ſhall make themſelves reſponſible for all the conſequences and all the unhappy effects which are therefrom inſeparable. And if after all this they make an out-cry in the world, and hold themſelves offended when ſuch diſorders are imputed to them, and when they are declared the Authors and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhers of theſe Irregularities, of Corruption, of Libertiniſm, which are ſpread over all conditions in theſe laſt times, they cannot attribute it to any other than themſelves, becauſe they are reproached with nothing but what they have avowed themſelves, in that they would not diſavow it, after it hath been repreſented unto them, and they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church.</p>
               <p>The Faithful ſhall at leaſt draw hence this advantage, that they may hereby diſcover the falſe Prophets and falſe Paſtors from the good and true ones, and take heed of thoſe who under a pretence of piety do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt piety it ſelf, ſeducing ſimple and innocent Souls, ſo far as to endeavour to hale them out of the boſom of their true and lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and to turn them away from their conduct, and engage them in horrible precipices.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Reaſons wherefore we take the Morals of the Jeſuits for the Subject of this Book rather than thoſe of other Caſuiſts.</head>
               <p>THat I produce in this Work no other Authors than thoſe of the Society of the Jeſuits, is not through any paſſion towards them, or toward others. For though I ſpeak not of other Caſuiſts; yet do I not neglect them entirely, as neither do I approve them, nor excuſe them, in their opinions which they have common with the Jeſuits, and which are conformable to thoſe which I reprove.</p>
               <p>But as he who would cut down a Tree, amuſes not himſelf in cutting off the branches one after another, but betakes himſelf to its body and root, which being cut, the branches muſt neceſſarily fall; and ſo, I <pb facs="tcp:46318:14"/>believe, that deſtroying the pernicious Doctrine of the Jeſuits, touching Manners, and Caſes of Conſcience, I overturn all at once, whatſoever there is conformable unto it amongst the new Caſuiſts, becauſe they are in a manner all their Diſciples; having learned that which they ſay in their Schools, or in their Books.</p>
               <p>After all this, the Jeſuits declare themſelves the Maſters of this ſort of new Learning, and they give this name to their principal Authors, whom they would have paſs for the Doctors and Maſters of the whole World. And they would, even that they might aſſure themſelves of the poſſeſſion of theſe Titles, eject the holy Fathers therefrom, endeavouring to hinder men from hearing them, from following them, and from imitating the example and holineſs of their lives by this pernicious Maxime which they have invented and eſtabliſhed, as a Principle of their Divinity; that it is not the ancient Fathers, but the new Divines and Caſuiſts of theſe times, who muſt be taken for the Rule of Manners and Chriſtian life.</p>
               <p>It is with the ſame Spirit that did teſtifie ſo great an eſteem for Novelty, they profeſs to follow it, and many amongst them, as
<hi>Poſa, Celot</hi> have taken in hand to defend it, to praiſe it, and to make Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for it.
<note place="margin">Quae circa fidem emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt difficulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes conſons ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teribus ſancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; quae vero circa mores ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no dignos à no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetiis ſcriptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. <hi>Reginald. Praeſat. ad lect.</hi>
                  </note> And hereby without doubt they deſigned to make the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption paſs for current, that they borrowed nothing at all from others, and eſpecially nothing from the Ancients, but that they produced their Opinions themſelves, and found them in their own heads; and that they have no other Rule for their conduct and their knowledge, but their own ſenſe and humane reaſon, and not the Authority of the Saints; and that being as it were Independents, they ought not to paſs for Children of the Fathers, and for Diſciples of the holy Doctors, but Maſters of Novelties amongst the Authors of theſe times.</p>
               <p>But although they think hereby to exalt their Doctrine, and to acquire more honour unto it, they diſgrace and ruine it themſelves in effect; becauſe that Novelty hath always been blamed as a mark of Errour, not only by the Catholicks, but alſo by the Hereticks, who have always affected and attempted to make people believe, that their Doctrine, as well as their Religion, were ancient, ſo that there were never any found, who would ſuffer themſelves to be reproached, much leſs who would boaſt themſelves to advance new Maxims, as is to be ſeen in the Example of the Lutherans and Calviniſts, who vaunt themſelves, though falſly, to follow the Doctrine of the ancient Church and of the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, and hold it for a great injury to be called Innovators, though indeed they be ſuch.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits, on the contrary, ſeem to affect this odious Title, ſince they deſpiſing the Authority of the holy Fathers, and renouncing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Ancients, prefer Novelty before them, and make open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to follow and invent new Opinions, which none had over pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before them, as is manifeſtly ſeen in the proper declaration of
<hi>Molina, Poſa, Amicus, Maldonat,</hi> and as may eaſily be proved by many other Caſuiſts of the Society.</p>
               <p>As they are the chief Maſters in this novel Science, ſo they are ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to make themſelves many Diſciples, who in time becoming Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, make up a Body ſo puiſſant, and an Aſſembly of probable Doctors <pb facs="tcp:46318:14"/>ſo numerous, that it would be hard to find ſo many in all other Societies taken altogether. So that whether we conſider the Votes, or compute them, they will ſtill prevail above all others, and remain the ſole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters and Maſters of this new Morality.</p>
               <p>And the better to maintain themſelves for ever in this advantage above other Caſuiſts and novel Doctors, knowing that Empire and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion amongst the Learned as well as amongst the Vulgar, is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by union, and ruined by diviſion, they are expreſly ordered by their Superiors to agree in the ſame opinions, and to maintain them all at leaſt as probable, and above all, when they are advanced by ſome of the Heads and principal Authors of the Society, and they believe that the intereſt and honour of their whole Body is in queſtion.</p>
               <p>This Conſpiration in the ſame Opinions whereto the Glory of the Society hath engaged them, does hold them faſtned thereto with ſo much obſtinacy, that no Conſideration nor Authority whatſoever, no not even of the Church, can oblige them to acquit them; or if they quit them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced thereunto by the publick Complaints and Cenſures, it is only in appearance, and for a time, and they afterwards reſume their very ſame opinions, and maintain and publiſh them as before, as one may ſee in the Books of the Engliſh Jeſuits, of <hi>Sanctarel,</hi> of <hi>Bauny,</hi> of
<hi>Celot,</hi> and of <hi>Poſa,</hi> and of divers others, who having been cenſured by the Church, they have diſavowed and ſuppreſſed them for a ſeaſon, but have ſhortly after produced them with the ſame opinions, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in them, and with the approbation of the Superiors of their Company.</p>
               <p>They have alſo eſtabliſhed upon the ſame foundation the inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confidence which they have had unto this preſent to handle the Caſes of Conſcience, and to govern Souls, not only in an imperious manner, but in a kind of Tyranny, and to paſs over all the primitive and true Laws of Chriſtian Morality and Diſcipline, that they may regulate all things according to their own proper reaſon and ſenſe, and ſometimes againſt their own proper thoughts, by their will only, regarding nothing but their own intereſt, and the ſatisfaction of the world, whom they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pleaſe, by conducting them rather according to their deſires, than according to the Rules of Truth, and for their Salvation.</p>
               <p>It is by this confidence joyned to ſo great complacency, that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to introduce themſelves in the world more than all others who hold their Maxims, and endeavour to get credit with all perſons, great and ſmall, who finding their Divinity favourable to their intereſt and their paſſions, do eaſily follow their advice and their conduct. And ſo they eaſily diffuſe every where the venom of their pernicious Doctrine, which brings looſneſs and corruption into all ſorts of conditions, as we ſhall make it evidently appear at the end of this Extract.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons have obliged me to take the Jeſuits Morals for my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in this Book, rather than thoſe of others who are in the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, conſidering that they are the firſt Maſters of this new Science; that they ſurpaſs others in number of Writers, as well as they believe themſelves to ſurpaſs them in knowledge; that they are the Inventors of many Opinions, and thoſe the moſt pernicious; that they are all of a piece, and agree together to ſuſtain them; that they are moſt obſtinate <pb facs="tcp:46318:15"/>in defending them, even then when they are condemned; that they are moſt advenurous and moſt inſinuating to diffuſe them unto the world, and moſt complacent to cauſe them to be received.</p>
               <p>So that I believe I ſhall combate all the corruption which Novelty hath introduced into Chriſtian Morality, by faſtning upon the Divinity of the Jeſuits, ſince it is all incloſed therein, as in the fountain from whence it diffuſeth it ſelf into the Spirits of other new Caſuiſts, who imitate them, and into the conſciences of the people of the world who follow them, becauſe of the facility of their conduct, who permit them every thing that they will, and ſometimes more than they durſt hope for.</p>

               <head>The Order of the Matters of this Book.</head>
               <p>I Diſtribute all this Book into three Books. In the firſt, I will handle the Principles of Sin, to make appear that the Jeſuits do eſtabliſh and nouriſh them. In the ſecond, I will ſpeak of the Remedies of Sin, to ſhew that they aboliſh or alter them. In the third, I will examine the particular Duties of every Profeſſion, and the Sins which they do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily commit, to ſhew that they excuſe and favour theſe laſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the firſt, by aboliſhing and obſcuring them in ſuch manner, that they appear not at all.</p>
               <p>The firſt Book ſhall have two Parts. The firſt ſhall be of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Principles of Sin, and the other of the Exterior. I will divide every Part into ſo many Chapters as there are Principles of Sin, which I ſhall take notice of. And when the abundance of matter, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of queſtions ſhall require it, I ſhall divide alſo the Chapters into Articles, the Articles into Points, and the Points into Paragraphs; I ſhall keep the ſame order in the other Books.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Harity and Luſt divide our whole life: theſe are the two Trees of the Goſpel, of which the one produceth alwayes good fruits, and the other can produce none but bad. As all the good which we do comes from the Spirit of God, who works it in us, and cauſes us to do it, forming in our hearts thoſe good deſires which are as it were the ſeed thereof: in the ſame manner Concupiſcence, which every one beateth within him, is the general ſource of all the temptations which we feel; or, to ſpeak better, it is a continual temptation, which carries us on to evil and ſin, in drawing us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> by ſecret ſollicitations, to ſenſual and temporal good, which ſerve for a bait and entertainment to our paſſions. This is that which made St. <hi>Leo</hi> to ſay,
<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Nullum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum ſine cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur, &amp; omnis illicitus appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus illius avidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, eſt morbus.</hi> S. Leo Serm. 9. de Paſſione, cap. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>That he committed no ſin without lust; and that every unlawfull deſire is a ſickneſſe and diſorder, which comes from that violent motion which carries us on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that to juſtifie that the Divinity of the Jeſuits makes an entertainment for ſin, we need no other proof, neither can any better be brought, than to ſhew that it favoureth and nouriſheth the luſts of men as much as it can upon all occaſions, as I ſhall make clearly appear in the whole progreſſe of this Book, by the ſimple repreſentation of their Opinions and their Maximes.</p>
                     <p>This Chapter of Luſt in general will notwithſtanding not be unprofitable; for that as our bodies are ſo compoſed of four qualities and four humours, that there is alwayes one which is predominant and prevails above all others, and <pb n="2" facs="tcp:46318:20"/>which at length gives the name unto the temperament, and cauſes one to be ſtiled melancholique, and another cholerique; thus likewiſe our ſouls are ſo, I will not ſay compoſed, but corrupted, by the luſts and paſſions which ſin hath produced therein, that there is no perſon who carries them not all in his boſome encloſed in concupiſcence, which is thereof the ſpring and principle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they appear not, nor act altogether equally in all ſorts of perſons; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> yet there is commonly one more ſtrong than the reſt, which domineers in every perſon, and which ſeems to be as it were proper unto him, adhering to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his age, his manner of living, and his condition or profeſſion: ſo we ſee that the luſts and paſſions of young people are other than thoſe of the ancient; that thoſe of perſons of great Birth, are different from thoſe of Peaſants, and Artificers; and thoſe of Merchants from thoſe of Lawyers.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe, that I may compleatly accompliſh the deſign I have undertaken, to prove that the Divinity of the Jeſuits doth favour the luſts and paſſions of men ſo much as is poſſible for it, and conſequently thoſe ſins which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and effects thereof, I will make it appear that in every condition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they cheriſh the luſt and vice which is peculiar thereunto; as namely, the covetouſneſſe and frauds of Merchants, the Ambition and Vanity of the Nobility, the in juſtice of Officers. But firſt of all I will ſay ſomething in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the more common luſts and paſſions, which are found in all men, and are in them as it were the ſpring of corruption, the matter of vices, and the cauſe of all ſins, as <hi>Hate, Pride, Covetouſneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Gluttony,</hi> and <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> For this purpoſe, I will divide this firſt Chapter into 6.

                        <hi>The third mark of hatred againſt our neighbour, is not to be willing to accompany him, to have ſuch an alienation, and ſo violent from him, as not to refuſe to talk with him upon any matter whatſoever, nor to aſſiſt him in his buſineſſe, or not to pardon him at all when he acknowledges his fault, and offers reaſonable ſatisfaction.</hi> And after he hath reported two authorities and two paſſages, one of St.
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and the other of St. <hi>Austen,</hi> in which theſe holy Doctors ſhew us the obligation we have to love, and wiſh well to one another, and to ſerve one another as members of the ſame body, he concludes boldly in this manner; <hi>Notwithſtanding I believe it is no mortal ſin to be wanting in theſe points, if it be not in caſe of ſcandal;</hi> that is to ſay, it is never, or almoſt never, mortal ſin, according to the doctrine which he eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Chap. 39. p. 623. that a man is not capable of the ſin of ſcandal, <hi>but when by a formal deſign he doth ſome thing to destroy his neighbours ſoul;</hi> which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of hell, and which ſeems not eaſily to come into the ſpirits of other perſons than the damned and Devils.</p>

                     <p>After this none can eaſily judge, but that the Reſolutions of theſe Authors ought to paſs in the Society, not only for common and aſſured Opinions, but alſo for Oracles, and almoſt for Articles of Faith, of which they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to doubt. And indeed the Book of this Jeſuit is in ſo great reputation in the Society,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> and they have ſo diſperſed it all over, that it hath been already printed 39. times, as is obſerved in the firſt Page.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi> who laboured near upon 40. years in the ſtudy of Moral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and to compoſe a Book, which he hath publiſhed in form of Aphoriſms, as he ſaith himſelf in his advice to the Reader, treating of Charity, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſay with <hi>Bauny</hi> and
<hi>Eſcobar,</hi> that one may without mortal ſin deſire never more to behold ones Enemy; but he addes thereto, that it is permitted to deſire his death, and to be well pleaſed that it is come upon him.
<note n="d" place="margin">
                           <hi>Potes optare hoſti tibi alioqui valde nocituro mortem, non odio, ſed ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num tuum: item de morte ejus gaudere ob bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num inde ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Emanuel Sa, verbo Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, n. 5. p. 46.</note> 
                        <hi>You may,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>deſire the death of an Enemy that is capable of doing you much hurt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you do not this out of hatred, but only to avoid the evil which he would do you. It is alſo permitted you to rejoyce in his death, becauſe of the good which may come to you thereby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We need only, according to this Author, love our own Intereſt, that we may without crime deſire the death of our Neighbour, and rejoyce in it when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls him. That is to ſay, that Covetouſneſs or Ambition may juſtifie a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous and inhumane ſoul; and that inſtead of being doubly culpable, it ought to paſs for innocent. For he condemns only theſe who deſire the death of a man in a frolick, and without being tranſported by any intereſt.</p>
                     <p>There is no Murderer nor Parricide who may not very well fit unto himſelf this maxim, and who may not eaſily make uſe thereof to cover his crime and his paſſion. If you reproach him, that in the fight of God he hath killed his Brother by the will and deſire he hath had to ſee him dead, he will tell you with this Jeſuit, that he had not deſired his death, but that he feared he would do him ſome miſchief: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="80"/>
                        <hi>non odio, ſed ad vitandum damnum,</hi> not out of hatred, but to avoid damage; or becauſe he might hinder him from enjoying ſome good, <hi>ob bonum inde ſecutum.</hi> So almoſt all mortal hatreds, and all revenges ſhall be permitted, becauſe they do not ariſe commonly but from worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46318:21"/>of Ambition, Covetouſneſs, and Pleaſure; and it belongs only to Devils and Deſperadoes to deſire the death of men of pure malice, and without deſign of drawing therefrom any worldly advantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bauny</hi> extends this maxim indifferently to all ſorts of perſons, and giveth the ſelf-ſame liberty to a Mother, who, according to him, may deſire the death of her Children. <hi>One may,</hi> ſaith he in the 6. Chapter of his Summe, p. 73. <hi>deſire evil to befall his Neighbour without ſin, when he is urged thereunto by any good motive.</hi> So <hi>Bonacina</hi> on the Firſt Commandment, <hi>d.</hi> 3.
<hi>q.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 7. <hi>exempts a Mother from all fault who deſired the death of her Daughters,

                     </p>
                     <p>He terms a lawfull motive to carry a Mother on to deſire the death of her Daughters, <hi>the want of beauty,</hi> for that they were not handſome, <hi>ob defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatem,</hi> or becauſe they were not rich enough,
<hi>aut inopiam:</hi> and becauſe ſhe could not marry them according to her deſire, that is, not after her ambition, or ſo advantagiouſly as ſhe would.</p>
                     <p>I leave it to the Reader to reflect upon this abominable maxim, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="90"/> and to draw conſequences from it. I wonder only that
<hi>Bauny</hi> did not carry it yet farther, and ſaid not, that this Mother might procure the death of her Daughters, as well as deſire it, provided ſhe might do it without ſcandal. For this ſeems to be the neceſſary conſequence of his opinion; for ſhe may do that which ſhe may deſire; the things which are lawfull to be deſired cannot be other than good and lawfull. And indeed this is the Doctrine of the Society, and almoſt of all the Jeſuits, aſſerting and maintaining it in other matters, changing only the examples and not the maxime, as I ſhall ſhew when I come to ſpeak of Murder. I will here only report as it were by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance one paſſage of <hi>Leſſius,</hi> who aſſures us,

                     <p>He ſpeaks in the ſame ſame manner of novelties, and of thoſe who invent new faſhions and new opinions, that they may as well content their own curioſity and vanity, as that of others, whom he alſo exempts from mortal ſin.

                        <hi>What is it that is called invention of novelties?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>It is a demonſtration of ones own excellence by certain actions, as in inventing new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or new ſorts of Garments. This invention of novelties is of it ſelf but a venial ſin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="140"/> if there occur no other circumſtance which may render it more criminal. His reaſon is: Becauſe commonly the Authors of theſe novelties do look after nothing but the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and praiſes of the World.</hi> Provided then that a man ſet his ſoul and heart one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the deſire of worldly honour and glory, this deſire is either not evil at all, or it is but a ſmall fault according to theſe Divines; and what ever one doth or ſaith for this end well or ill, with truth or falſehood, he ſhall not loſe the grace of God, nor fall ſhort of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>If this be no heynous fault, to boaſt himſelf, even of crimes, to invent novel opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to counterfeit actions of piety and vertue, to gain honour in the world, it muſt needs be that neither is it a great fault to deſire honour even with a deſire irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and vitious. For this cauſe <hi>Eſcobar</hi> concludes well, according to his own principles, in that place, where after he hath given us this definition of that haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind, which they commonly call Pride:

And although one cannot ſay that all the actions of men are good, yet notwithſtanding, the greater part even of thoſe which are bad, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="390"/> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ordinarily ſuch, but by the occurrence of evil circumſtances and evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, they will be all lawfull as well as the other: for it is ſufficient, according to this principle of <hi>Sanchez,</hi> that they be indifferent in themſelves, and conſidered in general; though in particular, with their evil circumſtances and effects which ariſe from them, they are very criminal, and this be certain and known by him who doth theſe actions, or ſells theſe things; becauſe he ſees clearly, that he for whom he doth them, or to whom he ſells them, will abuſe them: <hi>quamvis conſtet alterum abuſurum.</hi>

So they allow a Gentlewoman of good quality not to refuſe a man to enter into her houſe with whom ſhe hath offended God, if ſhe cannot ſo do it but that the world wil talk thereof; a maid-ſervant not to depart from the houſe of her Maſter who abuſeth her, if he will not pay her her wages; a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <pb n="17" facs="tcp:46318:27"/>not to quit the ſervice of his Maſter who imployes him in his debauches, if he receive or hope therefrom any good recompence.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the conſequences which the Jeſuits themſelves draw from this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, with many other which we ſhall ſee in their Caſuiſts. <hi>Sanchez</hi> who is the principal author of this maxim, after he hath eſtabliſhed it upon divers ſounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he propoſeth, amongſt many Concluſions which he drawes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, puts this ſame for the fifth:

                           <hi>It follows from this principle, that a ſervant may ſaddle the horſe of his Maſter, accompany and attend him, if it be not to defend him or ſtand centry for him, of which we speak in the next following numbers, although he well know that he goes to viſit debauched women.</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="410"/> And to expound what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by that reſtriction,
<hi>quando non cuſtodiae cauſa comitantur;</hi> He adds in the ſequel:

                           <hi>For if they go with their Master with a deſign to aſſault and combat his Corrivals, that is not lawfull, becauſe it is an action evil of it ſelf: but if they go only to defend their Maſter againſt thoſe who ſhall aſſail him, or to give him notice of any come to offend him, to the end that he may ſave himſelf without receiving any hurt, it is lawfull, though this very rarely, and only upon great neceſſity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is therefore true, according to <hi>Sanchez,</hi> that a ſervant may be innocent in all theſe occurrences, becauſe that he pretends that all theſe offices he doth for his Maſter,

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="420"/> and it is only needfull to conſider the ill uſe that may be made thereof, and the danger that therein may occurre:

<hi>Sanchez</hi> hath for this affair, hath drawn him on to borrow the quill of another to write that which he durſt not publiſh in his own proper name, contenting himſelf with a reaſon deduced from his principle, which is,
<note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Quia haec omnia ſunt ex ſe indifferentia, &amp; valde remote ſe habent ad peccatum.</hi> Ibid. n.

                           <hi>that all theſe things are of themſelves indifferent, and have no reference to ſin but from afarre off.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He finds, that to prepare a banquet for debauched men and women, to attend them at the table, to make their bed, are actions farr remote from ſin, though it follows ſo cloſe thereupon: and therefore they are lawfull to men and maid-fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and that there needs no other reaſon to juſtifie them in theſe affairs, than the ſervice they owe to their Maſters and Miſtreſſes; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="430"/> That is to ſay, that for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <pb n="18" facs="tcp:46318:28"/>to perform all theſe good offices to his Maſter without fear of ſin, it is enough that he be hired to ſerve him: But for a friend or any other perſon that would do ſo much, it behoves that he have ſome particular reaſon, as he declares in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe terms, ſaying,
<note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>At in non famulis aliqua justa cauſa deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraretur.</hi> ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>that if they are not ſerwants, it behoves that they have ſome juſt reaſon for to do it;</hi> which thing ſeems to agree very well with his principle. For if theſe actions in themſelves be indifferent, as he preſuppoſes, they may as well be lawfull for a friend as a ſervant, the quality of a friend giving no leſſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſerve a friend; than that of a ſervant a Maſter.</p>
                        <p>So that <hi>Hurtado</hi> is more reaſonable, and acknowledging the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this principle, he gives abſolutely the ſame liberty to a friend, a ſon, and to any other, as to an houſhold ſervant. For after he had ſaid,

                           <hi>That a ſon may do all the ſame things if his father command him, especially if he fear he ſhall draw on him his indignation if he refuſe. What a ſervant or a ſon may do in theſe occurrents, any other may do as well as they, if he hopes that thereby there may ſome conſiderable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit come to him, and much more for avoiding ſome great loſſe, or ſome great evil.</hi>

                        <p>As for carrying of preſents to diſhoneſt perſons,

                        </p>
                        <p>He is a little more troubled to permit ſervants to deliver meſſages, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="450"/> and to appoint meetings, and to carry them Love-letters; but that which hinders him principally, is, that this opinion is not commonly received, and that there are ſome who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this traffique as a thing that is evil in it ſelf:

                        <p>There is no ſon ſo unnatural who dares ſo much as think of letting a houſe which he holds of his father, to perſons whom he knowes to require it for no other end than therein to offend his own father, and to abuſe his own ſiſter, or his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if any ſon were capable of this exceſſe, there is no father who could ſuffer this affront, and who would not think himſelf in this more injured even by his ſon, than by his enemies, and thoſe who attempted to diſhonour him in this ſort; and yet according to the Divinity of the Jeſuites, God is not offended by ſuch unworthy uſage; and he will not take it ill, that a man who is related to him by ſo many titles of Son, Servant, and Creature, who holds all he hath of him, and who depends abſolutely upon him, lets out his houſe to offend him, and to commit crimes and abominations againſt him.</p>
                        <p>It is hard to have ſuch thoughts of God without renouncing faith, and even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf, and without repreſenting God as an Idol of wood, or ſtone, to beleeve that he is unſenſible of ſuch outrages and infamous actions as theſe; and to imagine that he would not take it ill, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="480"/> that a perſon who makes profeſſion to be his, and to ſerve him faithfully, not only ſuffers theſe in his houſe, but gives them his houſe to commit them in, without other reaſon than his intereſt; and even without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and without neceſſity, as ſome Jeſuits maintain.</p>
                        <p>So it is that <hi>Sanchez,</hi> who is the Maſter in this ſubject, after he had ſaid, that Navarre <hi>was therein too exact and too ſcrupulous, ſatis ſcrupulo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though at firſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that he finds ſome difficulty in giving abſolution to theſe perſons; yet for all that he afterwards facilitates the things in ſuch manner, that a Confeſſor who hath but a little contrivance, and is well entred in his opinions, ſhall have therein no trouble at all. He builds alwayes upon the ſame foundation, and draws from the ſame principles all the concluſions which he advances upon this matter.

                        <p>Another expedient propoſed by <hi>Sanchez</hi> for to juſtifie the deſire of fornication, or to take therein all the pleaſure that can be taken, is that which he teaches in the reſolution which he gives in this caſe, viz.

                     </p>
                     <p>And as for drinkings he gives there in the ſame liberty as in eating, although he takes not his meaſures from the ſame rule. The rule of temperance in eating, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Jeſuit, is to eat as much as you will, provided you do not vomit, and hurt your health; and the rule of temperance in drinking is according to the ſame, to drink as much as you can without loſing your judgement. Whence it comes that, according to this principle, after he had made this doubt:

                        <hi>One drinks to exceſſe, not ſo far as to be drunk, but in ſuch manner that his head akes, or the Wine diſturbes him in ſuch ſort, that he knows not very well what he doth; but yet he hath reaſon enough to know that he hath drunk too much.

<hi>I find no difficulty at all but that I may ſay, it is but a venial Sin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.</hi> And the reaſon is,

                     </p>
                     <p>The Heathen Philoſophers have ſpoken with more moderation, and they have been aſhamed to give ſo great liberty unto drunkards. But as the Jeſuits make more account of the uſage of reaſon then of the rules of vertue, ſo alſo they reſpect health above reaſon, and the intereſt of the body above that of the Soul. They maintain that provided, that reaſon continue found, temperance cannot be hurt; and they hold on the contrary, that reaſon may be ſtifled as well as temperance, to preſerve health.</p>
                     <p>This is the opinion of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> when he demaunds

<note n="g" place="margin">
                           <hi>Dicendum eſt, etiamſi eventus ſoleat eſſe frequenter ei qui inebriatur: ſi tamen tempore quo voluit inebriari, non habuit prorſus ullam dubitationem aut cogitationem de illis, nec in ſpecie, nec in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, minimè imputari culpae.</hi> Ibid.</note>

                        <hi>and that they commit them without reaſon and liberty.</hi> He adds alſo a third reaſon, which is, that

                        <hi>this exceſs which befals a man when he is drunk, does not commonly paſſe in the opinion of men for injurie, but rather for the moſt part for drollerie.

                     <p>He adds alſo in favour of theſe exceſſes,

                        <p>He alledges at firſt, ſome Doctors who hold that he is obliged to make reſtitution. But he adds in diſavowing them; <hi>My judgement is not according to theirs. For none is bound to reſtore if he hath not violated juſtice. Doth one do this when he ſubmits himſelf to another? when he requests a favour; whatſoever deſires he had to obtain it by his means, whatſoever demaunds he makes to have it done for him, he continues ſtill free to graunt or to deny it; to what part ſoever he incline, it is his own will which moves him, whether it be the ſweetneſs or the eaſineſs of his own ſpirit, there is nothing obliges him, but his own good will. If therefore he makes no amends for what he hath <pb n="35" facs="tcp:46318:36"/>done, if he reſtore not things unto their former eſtate, you muſt not compel him to it, at whoſe requeſt he was induced to offend the innocent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He will have one believe that it is but demanding a favour of a Souldier to pray him to beat a man, or to burn a Farm, for to revenge himſelf on him, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is no injuſtice, that ſo he may diſpenſe with him for the reſtitution who is the Author and hath cauſed the thing to be done by another.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, ſpeaking of the Souldier who outrages a perſon, or burns his Farm at the requeſt of another, he ſaith that
<hi>nothing obliged him thereto, but the goodneſs, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eaſineſs of his Spirit.</hi> If this action ſo cruel and ſo inhumane can paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jeſuits for goodneſs and ſweetneſs, its hard to judge who will paſs among them for cruel and barbarous, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="850"/> unleſs haply they who will not follow their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                        <p>But if this man who by the counſel of <hi>Banny</hi> finds himſelf diſcharged of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to make reſtitution, be ſo happy as to meet with <hi>Sanchez,</hi> or ſome other who is well inſtructed in his maximes, he may perhaps learn alſo from him that there is no ſin at all in commanding to kill, to burn, or to commit all thoſe other exceſſes, eſpecially, if he be ignorant or ill inſtructed in the things that belong unto ſalvation and conſcience.

                        <p>It is not onely true in the Church, that juſt and honeſt men live by Faith, but one may alſo ſay the ſame thing of all men who live together in any ſort of humane Society.

                        <p>VNfaithfulneſs and deceit, of which we ſpeak here, is a true theft diſguiſed and covered with ſome falſe pretence of apparent reaſon. There are many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are diſpoſed to deceive; but they to whom there remains ſome little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are troubled in doing it; the light of nature alone, which is not intirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd in them, makes them to ſee clear enough in the bottom of their hearts, that this is not lawfull, they muſt needs firſt deceive themſelves, that they may deceive others. And as for the moſt part, men have not ſpirit and invention enough for this, they want ſome body to aide and furniſh them with reaſons to blinde and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that they may with a good conſcience do that which even their conſcience it ſelf teaches them they cannot do, when they conſult and hearken to it without preoccupations.</p>
                        <p>The Jeſuits of all the perſons of the world are moſt capable to do theſe good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and ſufficiently inclinable of themſelves to pleaſure the whole world. It muſt needs be a very ſtrange and extraordinary caſe in this matter, if they find not expedients to reſolve it to the content of him who conſults with them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="950"/> There is no perſon of what condition ſoever he be, who doth prudently make uſe of their adviſe, who may not do all his affairs by deceit, and yet not paſs, for all that, for a cheat, or unfaithful, according to the maximes of their Divinity.</p>

                        <p>But if this deceit hath been found out onely to hinder that Sacriledge might not be committed, doth the ſinner who is wholly reſolved, and ready to commit it in preſenting himſelf to the communion, ceaſe to commit it before God, when he receives that Hoaſt which he believed to be conſecrated, though it be not at all; as <hi>Herod</hi> endeavouring to put to death the Son of God newly born, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo many murders of God as he made Infants to be killed with a deſign to involve our Lord in the univerſal maſſacre.</p>

Without the Word of God there would neither be World nor Religion, and if men were not faithful to keep their words, the Church and the World would ſoon become a deſert and a confuſion; Cities would be without Government, Kingdoms without Laws, and civil and religious Corporations without diſcipline; and for that cauſe there would be nothing but diſorder, diviſion, unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and treachery.

                           <p>He adds alſo in the ſame place a third way to ſwear by equivocations, which is very eaſie and very favourable to ſtammerers that cannot pronounce certain letters.

I. To take the words which he uſes in ſwearing, and which are falſe in their true and natural ſenſe, in a quite different ſenſe ſuch as he pleaſes, provided it be true. II. To give no ſenſe at all to his words and to take them materially, that is to ſay as ſounds that ſignifie nothing. He pretends that he that ſwears in one of theſe two ways doth no great evil, though that he ſays be falſe in the ordinary ſenfe.</p>
                           <p>But if a man have an intention to aſſert that which is falſe, and to confirm it with an oath, he avows, that he ſins mortally.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1250"/> and which he doth conceive in his mind, he ſins not at all mortally.</hi> See here the firſt ſecret, to which he adds another like it, proceeding in theſe terms:
<note n="e" place="margin">

                              <hi>But, if he take theſe words onely materially, without deſign to uſe them to ſignifie any thing at all, he ſins not mortally.</hi> He fears to be yet too exact and rigorous in this point. For which cauſe he corrects and ſweetens his anſwer, ſaying; <hi>I believe that he ſins not at all, no not venially, becauſe there is nolye in that which he ſaith.</hi> Strange reaſoning! This man confirms by an oath words that are falſe, and yet he is not perjured; he expreſſes one thing, and thinks another.

                           <p>Theſe ſhifts are ſo groſſe that the moſt ſimple and moſt ignorant may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.

                           <p>But if we would believe theſe Maſters of equivocations, there is no need at all of ſo many ſhifts and fallacies, for they declare plainly that thoſe who have not wir enough to underſtand theſe diſquizes and mental reſtrictions, or not to make uſe of them upon occaſion, may ſwear plainly without obliging themſelves in any ſort whatſoever, provided they have no intent to ſwear, nor to promiſe that which they ſwear. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1260"/>

It is this deſire which the Scripture teſtifies that God hears and accompliſhes, as the moſt excellent and powerful prayer, where he ſaith; <hi>Deſiderium pauperum exaudivit Dominus. The Lord hears the deſire of the poor.</hi> It is then earneſtly to demand a thing to teſtifie that it is deſired, though it be not demanded in words.

                              <hi>yet they will never the leſſe bear it, by adding that which he who ſpeaks them reſerves in his thoughts.</hi> This ſay I is deſtroyed by it ſelf, the thought of a man which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward and inviſible, cannot at all change the ſence of words, which are all-together outward and ſenſible, nor give them that which they cannot receive: otherwiſe every one may by his will and according to his phantaſie give every ſort of words all ſorts of ſences, and make them ſignifie any thing. And ſo it will be impoſſible for one to underſtand another, and thoſe of the ſame country ſhall be as ſtrangers to one another.</p>
                           <p>This Doctor gives the ſame liberty to circumſtances as to the ſubſtance of words, ſaying that one may give them by thought alone ſuch ſence as one will, in ſuch time, and in ſuch manner, and on ſuch ſubject and motive as one will, without other motive

                           <p>See here <hi>Sanchez</hi> firſt method, which ſerves for nothing but to learn to lye purely, ſimply, and without equivocation, by uſing words that are not equivocal in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at all, and which cannot ſignify that which one ſaith, nor that which is in ones mind at all, as he affirms himſelf. So that ſuch words are contrary to the thoughts which he hath, and he ſaith really other things then he thinketh; which is to lye formally and ſimply.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond method is no better then the former, for he ſaith one may
<note n="c" place="margin">Vel intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do aliam diem ab ea aqua fecit.</note> 
                              <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (or ſupply out of ones mind)</hi> that he hath not done the thing <hi>on an other day then that on which he did it;</hi> 
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1450"/> or elſe that he hath not done it in an other place, an other time, or an other company, or with other circumſtances of which he gives him choice, leaving him entire liberty to make uſe of which he pleaſes to deceive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple. For his words are clear and general:
<note n="d" place="margin">Vel intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo aliud quodvis addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum verum, quodcunque illuct ſit.</note> 
                              <hi>Or intending,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſome quite other thing, and quite other circumstance which he pleaſes to add, which is true, of what ſort ſoever it be.</hi> And with theſe precautions, if you will believe him,
<note n="e" place="margin">Revera non mentitur nec perjurus est.</note> he lyes not at all in effect; and is not perjured, imagining and pretending to make us believe that he hath ſpoken no falſe thing, and that he hath ſpoken the very truth, though he ſay not that which is demanded of him, nor that which the words he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth ſignifie of themſelves, <hi>but an other truth altogether different; ſed aliam veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem disparatam.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is a true way to be able to juſtifie all manner of lyes and perjuries; the greateſt lyar and the greateſt impoſtor may make uſe hereof to juſtify and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf in theſe crimes, in ſaying that his meaning was other than his ſaying; and that ſo

                              <hi>He is really neither lyar nor perjured; but onely did not ſpeak preciſely a truth, which they underſtood who did hear him, and which his words ſignified; but another truth which had no thing ommon therewith.</hi> But that for this they had no cauſe to complain of what he ſaid to them and anſwered in this manner, they having no right to queſtion him. For he preſuppoſeth as a general maxime,
<note n="g" place="margin">Quia alteri reſpondere non obligatus, nec obligatur reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere ad ejus mentem.</note> 
                              <hi>that when one is not obliged to anſwer a perſon, neither is he obliged to anſwer according to his thoughts.</hi> Which he ſupports by a maxime of Logick which ſaith:
<note n="h" place="margin">A quo enim removetur ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, omnis quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſpecies remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur.</note> 
                              <hi>That when the general kind of any thing is removed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1460"/> the ſpecial ſorts are alſo removed.</hi> This reaſoning he ſaith he learned from <hi>Navarre;</hi> who ſaith that when one is not obliged to anſwer a perſon, he may anſwer him in what manner he pleaſes: he is not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give him an honeſt, civil, true, ſincere, faithful one, but that he may make one in all points contrary, for that we may make him none if we pleaſe.</p>
                           <p>There is none that ſees not clearly what follows from this, that incivil conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, eſpecially amongſt equals, where one hath no authority over others, nor right to queſtion them nor to oblige them to anſwer to that which is propoſed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them, every one may ſay what he will, and underſtand what he will by his words without apprehending that he lies, and believing that he ſpeaks the truth, becauſe he repreſents it in his minde though he hide it, or expreſſe even the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his words. But there is great difference betwixt conceiving or thinking the truth and ſpeaking or ſignifying it to others. Thoſe who will follow this Jeſuit, ſhall have the truth in their thoughts, but not in their words; they conceive it well, but they do not ſpeak it at all; and in this they are lyars and perjured, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their intentions and ſecret thoughts, for to lye is no other thing then to ſpeak otherwiſe then a man thinks, and to ſay one thing having another in his thoughts.</p>

                           <p>AFter they have made the uſe of equivocations ſo free, ſo common, and ſo eaſie, that all the world may make uſe of them indifferently on all occaſions, there remains nothing for the Maſters of this art, that is to ſay the Jeſuits, to do, but to eſtabliſh well the practice, and to fortify themſelves in ſuch ſort againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whatſoever precaution they uſe; no perſon may be able to hinder them from making uſe thereof when they will, nor to diſcover it when they have uſed it.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Sanchez</hi> hath attempted to do, and in this he hath laboured with great care, and he hath proceeded therein beyond all other who have written on this matter. After he hath eſtabliſhed many rules, given many advices about equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and the manner to form and make uſe of them, he concludes with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as the laſt and moſt important:

He confeſſes that there is falſity, and by conſequence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in the anſwer of thoſe who make uſe of theſe equivocations in the manner he teaches them to illude the intergatories of a Judge; and he notes himſelf this falſity and perjury, though he expreſſe it modeſtly enough, calling it

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1560"/> Though both the one and the other are in no wiſe acceſſory thereto, and give onely occaſion to commit it by forbidding it expreſſely, and uſing all the precaution they could to hinder it.

                           <p>And this is that, without doubt, for which he imputes the malice to the Judge, that he would hinder the accuſed from uſing his right that he hath, and cauſe him to ſpeak ſincerely, where he hath right to ſpeak equivocally, and by conſequence to condemn him of injuſtice and malice who would hinder him from uſing this right. He then ſets the Judge in the place of the malefactor, and the malefactor in the place of the Judge, making the malefactor Judge of his Judge himſelf, and giving him liberty to judge and condemn him even when he forſwears himſelf in his preſence, by anſwering according to his own fancy, and not according to the Judges interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; and makes him ſay unto his Judge unawares to him: (for this is the ſecret and the <hi>retentum</hi> of the equivocation, which paſſeth inwardly in his minde:)

                     <p>BEyond all which we have ſpoken hitherto, it may be known clearly, by a general proof, that the Jeſuits nouriſh and favour as much as they can the luſts of men, by conſidering what they ſay to the diſadvantage of charity. For as charity and luſt are two contrary motions and loves which divide our heart, in ſuch manner that it is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways poſſeſſed and moved by the one or the other; and it hath ſo much more of luſt, as it hath leſs of harity; luſt cannot be favoured more nor eſtabliſhed more forcibly in the heart of man to cauſe it to reign continually through his whole life and all his actions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1620"/> then by chaſing charity away from thence, for to reduce it to ſuch a ſtreight as that it cannot be more diminiſhed, nor have leſſe extent, without being entirly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.

                     <p>There are ſome who pretend that a man is never obliged, upon any occaſion, nor at any determinate time, to love God, in all the courſe of his life, nay, nor even at death. The more religious reduce this great and firſt commandment to a certain time, and certain occaſions which are very rare and diſtant.

                        <hi>The ſecond opinion holds,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that it behoves to love God above all things, in preferring him above them, and eſteeming him more; but not in loving him with more tenderneſs. This is the common judgement of Divines, which is true and which ought to be followed.</hi> And for to expound this more clearly, he addeth;
<note n="g" place="margin">

                        <hi>All preference comes from a judgement by which after we have compared two things, we chooſe the one and leave the other. For becauſe I judge that the one thing is worth more than the other, I preferr that which I judge to be the better.</hi> He diſtinguiſhes here two acts; the one is that by which we compare two things together; and the other, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1640"/> that by which we give the preference to that which we judge the better. And he puts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precicative love in the latter of theſe two acts, which is for all that an act of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of underſtanding as well as the former. So that to love God more than all the creatures appretiatively or by preference, according to him, is no other thing then <hi>to Judge, that God is better and more perfect then all the Creatures.</hi> But this may be done by the greateſt Sinner as well as by the greateſt Saint, this judgement being more in the head than in the heart, and proceeding more from knowledge and light of minde than from affection.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it is clear that one may eſteem them much whom he loves not at all, and alſo more than thoſe whom he loves. And there is nothing more common then to eſteem thoſe for whom one has no true affection at all, but an intire indifference. So that this eſteem and this judgement cannot be named love but improperly; he he who ſets not his love which is due unto God, above all things, otherwiſe then in in this judgement and in this eſtimation, which makes him prefer him above all things, as deſerving to be beloved above all things, doth not at the bottom <pb n="67" facs="tcp:46318:52"/>attribute unto him any true love at all, and holds in effect that there is no love due to him at all.</p>
                     <p>But if theſe Doctors who know to give to their own words, as well as to thoſe of others, ſuch ſence as they pleaſe, even that which they have not, and which they cannot have naturally, as we have made appear in the former Chapter; I ſay, if theſe Doctors that they may not ſeem to aboliſh intirely the commandment of love to God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1650"/> ſay that although they place this love that is due to God in the eſteem which we ought to make of him above all the creatures; they exclude not for all this from that preference all ſort of affection for God, and that they ſuppoſe we have always ſome love for him. They reduce elſewhere this love, whatſoever it be according to them, to ſo baſe a degree, that they teſtifie ſufficiently that all their explications are rather to diſguiſe their judgement, than to expound it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that not daring abſolutely to deny the commandment of loving God, they diminiſh and deface, as much as they can, the love which they ſuppoſe to be due unto him.</p>

                        <hi>It is manifest,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>following the principles which I have eſtabliſhed, that this love of God may be had, though it be weak in the loweſt degree, becauſe we may have ſuch an opinion and eſteem of God,

                     </p>
                     <p>If this be to love God <hi>to judge that he merits to be beloved,</hi> the greateſt ſinners, Infidels, and Devils themſelves be capable of this love, and if to love as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, it be ſufficient <hi>to be moved but ſlenderly, and to have for him an affection weak to the lowest degree;</hi> We muſt raze out or correct the commandment which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we <hi>love him with all our ſtrength and with all our heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus theſe Divines, deſtroying the love of God in the hearts of men, cauſe the love of the world to reign there; and reducing the love which is commanded us, to the utmoſt point and loweſt degree that it can be in, they give all liberty to luſt, and leave it all the extent of the heart and of the affections.</p>

                        <hi>When this Prelate writes that it is lawful for a ſecular to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite with his wife, he would ſay that it is lawful for him to bring up his children, to take care of the affairs of his Family; to deſire dignities with moderation, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the world; to follow his own free inclinations, to take pains to hoard no wealth; and to cloſe up all in a word, but which is an hierarchique and a Holy one, to lead his life altogether divided and diſtinct, diſparting his affections and thoughts to many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent objects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Chryſostom</hi> ſaith abſolutely that a ſecular hath no licence more then a Monk, except that he may co-habite with his wife.

                     <p>This eſtate of free diſpoſing of our wills was that of

                        <hi>For to make himſelf more complaiſant towards</hi> Mary <hi>who was to be conceived without original ſin, he delivered her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the original corruption more readily then Saint</hi> John. <hi>And I ſee not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>why the liberality of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be greater towards Saint</hi> John, <hi>then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Grand-father and Grand-mother. Saint</hi> John <hi>being Conſin unto the Virgin: but this proximity being onely in the collateral line, it is leſſe then that of Fathers and Mothers and other Anceſtors who are in the right line: Saint</hi> John <hi>was the fore-runner of our Lord: but this dignity is not ſo proper to preſſe the bounty of Jeſus Chriſt, as that which ariſes from the quality of Father and Mother in reſpect of</hi> Mary.</p>
                     <p>This is a great raſhneſs, and a reaſoning altogether carnal and groſſe, to preferre the natural quality of Father and Mother of the Virgin, to the Holy and eminent quality of the fore-runner of Jeſus Chriſt, by which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſurpaſſed all the greateſt Saints, and all the Prophets. But this is yet a greater temerity, and a thought yet more carnal, to attribute the grace of God to natural conditions of fleſh and blood, againſt the moſt clear and certain principles of Faith. Finally this is a third exceſſe, to maintain, Saint <hi>Joachim</hi> and Saint
<hi>Anne</hi> had ſo much or more grace and Holyneſs then Saint <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> ſince it is formally to contradict Jeſus Chriſt, who hath declared that amongſt all the Saints who were born before <hi>John,</hi>

The Phariſees who looked narrowly into all the actions of Jeſus Chriſt to reprove them, never found in all his life the leaſt occaſion to reproach him that he acted humanely, and with acceptation of perſons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1750"/> preferring his kindred before others.

                        <hi>But for fear that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould let looſe the reins unto ambition, and that the love which he had to his kindred might not appear too exceſſive, he choſe none of them, to make him Prince and Chief of the Apoſtles: but he choſe Saint</hi> Peter <hi>who was of another Family, and of another Neighbouring Town.</hi> So that, according to the thoughts of this Author, vanity, and the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men did a little hold back the ambition of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that if he had not been afraid to diſcover, and make too much to appear that paſſion which he had to make great his kindred, as he had already advanced many to the Apoſtleſhip, he had alſo it may be choſen ſome one of them to make him head of the Apoſtles. But if Jeſus Chriſt could prefer his kindred before other men to make them Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their kindred, as this Jeſuit pretends; why could not he by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon give them the primacy over the Apoſtles? If it had been too great ambition to do the ſecond, as he ſuppoſes, it had been alſo ambition, according to him, though leſſe, to do the former. The extremeſt point of impiety of the Jews in the time of the Law, and of Tyrants ſince the coming of Chriſt, hath been to ſet Idols in the Temples,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1760"/> and on the Altars conſecrated unto God. But this is a far greater exceſs to ſet luſt, that is to ſay, the ſpring of all ſins, of all diſorders, of all the evils in the world, in God himſelf, and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Holy Fathers have obſerved that the Devil never found any artifice or means more efficacious to authorize vice, and give it a free courſe among Pagans, then to let them ſee the examples of it in the actions of the falſe gods, it being eaſie to carry them on to imitate thoſe whom they adored. The Jeſuits do the ſame thing, In a manner more criminal, attributing to the Saints, and even unto Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, humane motions, and earthly deſires, and paſſions of fleſh and blood, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading men alſo that they are not evil, and that they may follow them in their conduct; or rather that they are obliged to do them, ſince the Goſpel teaches us to follow Jeſus Chriſt in all things, in the conduct of our lives, and the regulation of our manners.</p>

                     <hi>It follows from that which I have ſaid, that he who from the impreſſion of an inveterate cuſtom, as it were by a ſort of impetuous neceſſity, is tranſported to do evil, as to speak words of blaſphemy, or perjury, ſins not at all; and to speak properly blaſphemes not at all, becauſe a man cannot ſin at all without rational knowledge and deliberation.</hi> Following his principles there are no habitual ſins at all, ſince evil cuſtom not onely doth neither cauſe nor augment ſin, but alſo diminiſheth it, and ſometimes takes it wholly away, and a perſon who blaſphemes, forſwears, and doth every other criminal thing that can be, ſins not according to this maxime, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1830"/> when it comes from <hi>an evil inveterate cuſtom,</hi> which is become natural,
<hi>which carryes him on to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of all theſe crimes
<hi>by a kind of neceſſary impreſſion,</hi> almoſt without any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible apprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>So the condition of this man, altogether corrupt and altogether plunged in vice, ſhall be better then of another leſſe vicious, and exempt from wicked habits. This man by often ſinning ſhall be put into an eſtate of not ſinning any more, and into a kind of, for him, happy neceſſity, which will give him a power to commit all ſorts of crimes ſecurely, freely and without being more criminal, or even at all guilty. But if it be true that by multitude of ſins a man becomes uncapable of ſinning, and that multitude of ſins make a man innocent; this would be a powerful motive to carry men on to all ſorts of vices and exceſſe, and to ſet men farther from virtues, whoſe exerciſe is more painful, and never brings that advantage of being uncapable of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or to have power to commit the greateſt ſins without ſinning.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of Sins of Ignorance. <hi>That Ignorance excuſes ſins committed without knowing them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1840"/> and even thoſe which are committed afterwards: And that there is properly no ſins of Ignorance, according to the Jeſuits.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere is a particular connexion, and as it were a natural conſequence betwixt ſins of evil habits, and ſins of Ignorance. For one of the effects of an evil habit is by little and little to ſtifle the remorſes of ſin, and by conſequence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all thoughts of it, and to take away the knowledge of it. For this cauſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before viewed what the Jeſuits ſay of habitual ſin, order requires that we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their opinion of thoſe which are committed by ignorance.</p>
                  <p>Ignorance may be conſidered, either in regard of thoſe ſins which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without knowledge of them, or in regard of thoſe which have been heretofore committed, without thinking to do evil. And it may be inquired if the firſt be true ſins: and what is to be done when we come to apprehend that the ſecond are ſo.</p>
                  <p>As to the latter point, <hi>Bauny</hi> (in his Summe, chap.
40. pag. 650. and 651) holds <hi>that if any one of ignorance and ſimplicity hath confeſſed his faults in groſſe, without determining of any one in particular, it will not be needful to draw out of his mouth the repetition of thoſe faults, if it cannot be commodiouſly done, becauſe the Confeſſor is preſſed ſo with penitents which give him not leaſure.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1850"/> He would ſay, that on the Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days when the Confeſſors are preſſed it will ſuffice to make a general confeſſion, without ſpecifying any one ſin in particular, as the Hugenots would have it.</p>
                  <p>After this queſtion he propoſes another: <hi>And what may we ſay of thoſe who in their youth have committed muny actions of a vicious nature, which notwithſtanding they did not believe to be ſuch?</hi> He anſwers definitively, that <hi>they are not obliged to confeſſe one word of them, when they know them and underſtand their nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, much leſſe to reiterate their confeſſions made already.</hi> Whence it follows that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might have diſpenſed with himſelf to do penance for the ſins he had committed in his youth before his converſion, being he committed them through ignorance, as he tells us himſelf:
<hi>Ignorans feci incredulitate;</hi> I did them ignorantly in unbelief; and
<hi>David</hi> ought not to ſay:
<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Delicta juven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis meae &amp; ignorantias meas ne memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris Domine. Pſ.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note>
                     <hi>Lord remember not the ſins of my youth and of my ignorance.</hi> A ſage Phyſitian will not give this counſel to a patient whom he knows to have of a long time laboured of ſome hidden diſeaſe, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to appear, and to make it ſelf known by the pain to him who had it without knowing of it. He will not counſel him to keep it always hid without ſpeaking a word, but that he diſcover it ſpeedily, and that he cauſe himſelf to be cured.</p>
                  <p>But this opinion of <hi>Bauny</hi> may perhaps be founded upon a principle which <hi>Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liutius</hi> propoſes as probable; to wit, that even criminal ignorance doth not make confeſſion invalid.

                     <hi>For otherwiſe it would be neceſſary to repeat a multitude of confeſſions.</hi> Whence he concludes, <hi>that if we ought to follow the contrary opinion in the practice, this would make the charge and the yoke of confeſſion too weighty.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt becauſe that he could not confeſs ſo many people, and that he ſhould have therein too much pains, and alſo would give too much trouble to thoſe who are to confeſs if he obliged them to examine themſelves ſeriouſly, or confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over again; when being not well examined they had forgot ſome notorious crimes.

                     <hi>It behooves,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to conſider actually that which is done actually, for to judge whether the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be faulty and exempt not a man from ſin.</hi> And a little after: <hi>This is not enough to commit mortal ſin to conſider and to will with deliberation the evil that is done, but this conſideration and deliberation muſt be full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not ſufficient, with him, to have a cogniſance of the evil; but he wills alſo that time be had to deliberate whether to do it or not; and he is not contended even with this, but he pretends that this knowledge and this deliberation ought to be full, in ſuch ſort that there be no darkneſs nor clouds. For if you ask him what he intends by full deliberation and knowledge, he makes uſe, for explication, of an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a man who is perfectly awaked in his right underſtanding, and in this eſtate thinks ſeriouſly of a thing.

                  </p>
                  <p>His opinion therefore is, that the knowledge which is neceſſary to moſt obdurate ſinners, to make them conſider and ſee the evil which they do, muſt be as great and as perfect as it can be in the moſt virtuous perſons, who have not their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nor their evil habits, and that without this knowledge they cannot ſin mortally; that is to ſay, he will have a man that is in darkneſs and at midnight to ſee as clear as he who is at high noon, and a blind man to perceive and judge colours as well as he who hath his eyes ſound and intire. For paſſions and vices, and evil habits are properly the darkneſs and blindneſs of the ſoul: and to pretend farther, as he doth that for want of a full and perfect knowledge, a man given up to vice and accuſtomed to ſin, ſins not mortally, is as if he ſhould ſay, that he could not ſin mortally in that eſtate, and the more this man advances in darkneſs and blindneſs continuing this wicked life, by ſo much he ſhall be farther off from ſin and from power to ſin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that by the conſummation of his evil cuſtom, being alſo the conſummation of his blindneſs, he be made intirely and abſolutely without power to ſin.</p>

                     <hi>If we know one part of the malice, or if we be ignorant of it by our own fault, it ſhall be imputed for a ſin.</hi> Whence he draws this concluſion which we have already reported; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1940"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>He ſtays not there. For it is not ſufficient for them that a man hath heretofore known an action to be wicked, they hold that if he hath forgotten it, or if he yet know it, but doth not actually think of it, and does not make reflection upon it, ſo as to perceive, at the very time when it is committed, that it is evil, he offends not God at all, at leaſt not grieviouſly.</p>

For thoſe who know not that there is a Hell, know not commonly that there are any mortal ſins, ſince mortal ſin is not called mortal but becauſe it kills the ſoul, depriving it of ſpiritual life, which is the grace of God; which is altogether unknown to infidels who know nothing of Hell.</p>

But according to the rule of theſe Jeſuits, there is no Hell for all theſe perſons, of which notwithſtanding the number is but too great, particularly in the Country. And by conſequence we cannot complain of their ignorance, nor of their Friends and Paſtors for the little care they have taken to inſtruct them: but rather we ought to envie theſe perſons, and bleſſe their ignorance; and advertiſe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours to be careful not to draw them out of it, for fear of opening unto them the gate of Hell,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2000"/> by giving them the knowledge thereof, and making them fall into ſin by inſtructing them and inlightening them, thereby making them know the ſins whereunto they are ſubject.</p>

<hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> it ſelf, when he ſaith that we cannot therein contribute ſo much as our cares and induſtry, and that it muſt come to us without any endeavour, and without any preparation, not by God, but by fortune; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling alſo into the exceſſe which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> falſely imputed to the Catholiques, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing them to attribute grace and good works to fortune and deſtiny; becauſe the Catholiques maintained that we could not have it by our own proper forces. So that this Jeſuit confirms the argument of <hi>Pelagians,</hi> condemned by the Catholiques,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2030"/> and the errour of the Pagans condemned by the Pelagians and Catholiques together.</p>
                  <p>It would have becomed the piety of a Religious man, and the light of a Chriſtian, to have given at leaſt to God the firſt thought which is the principle and foundation of all good works, and not to nature, and much leſs to fortune, whoſe very name ought to be baniſhed out of the Church, according to the judgement of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and left unto

                  <p>It ſeems that he ſuffered himſelf to be tranſported unto this extravagance, that he might wholly excuſe the ſins of ignorance.

                     <hi>It happens rarely or never that a man is obliged to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for grace to come out of ignorance and to render it excuſable.</hi> That is, to ſpeak properly, that he who knows not what he is obliged to know, is rarely obliged to prepare himſelf for that grace which is neceſſary for him that he may learn it, nor to demand this grace of God, becauſe prayer is the principal diſpoſition unto grace, and the firſt and the moſt general means to obtain it. Which accords very well with what <hi>Sanchez</hi> now ſaid, having learned out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that, the firſt thought which is neceſſary to know that which we are obliged to do and to know, comes from fortune, and preſents it ſelf naturally to us without our troubling our ſelves, and ſo that we cannot by our care and induſtry contribute any thing at all to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: ſo that in effect it were to torment our ſelves in vain to labour in a thing which depends not on us, and to mock God to demand it of him, being it comes by fortune, and not by his grace and the order of his will.</p>
                  <p>It may ſeem that this is the utmoſt exceſſe whereunto a man can be tranſported, to excuſe ignorance. For if it be not imputed unto us, even not then when it comes of ſin, and which is by conſequent criminal in it ſelf, though we endeavour not to get out of it, nor take care onely ſo much as to pray unto God to deliver us out of it, it can never be ſin, whence it will follow according to this new Doctrine, that there is no more any thing to be ſaid properly of ſins of ignorance, and that Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were unlearned, and ill informed in the wiſdom of the Jeſuits, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God to pardon the ſins of their youth, and their ignorances.</p>

                  <div type="introduction">
                     <p>THe Jeſuits ſpeak very many things touching good and bad intention, to favour mens vices and looſeneſs; nevertheleſs they may be reduced to two principal heads; whereof the one is, that to do evil there muſt be an evil intention; and the other, that to do good it is not neceſſary to have a good intention. They conclude from hence that the commandments of God and the Church may be ſatisfied by an outward execution of what they ordain, though it be done without intention to fulfil them, or with an evil intent and contrary to the commandment, and even with an expreſſe intention not to fulfil it: and on the contrary, to render a man guilty of having violated the commands of God, and the Church, it is not ſufficient to violate them, but it is required to have thereof a formed deſign and expreſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. For the greater facility, I will handle theſe two points ſeverally, and divide this Chapter into two Articles.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="1" type="article">
                     <head>ARTICLE I. <hi>That the Jeſuits teach that we may fulfil the Commandments of God and the Church, not onely without intention,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2060"/> but with an intent contrary and altogether criminal.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis is the expreſſe opinion of <hi>Bauny,</hi> in his Summe, chap. 20. pag. 335. where after he had ſaid with other Caſuiſts, that the Eccleſiaſtiques ſatisfie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of receiving their office, when they ſing or read their hours, though they do it without inward attention or devotion, provided they obſerve outward modeſty, whereof he gives this reaſon: <hi>For the outward action,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wherewith we attend on God is of the ſame nature, retinue, and appertaines to the vertue of Religion. Then as he who without intention to Idolize it bends his knee before an Idol, is nevertheleſs guilty of Idolatry: So we are to believe that they pray who recite the office, although with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intention, though not without the outward decence and compoſement that ſuch an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the outward appearance will be more neceſſary to prayer, and the actions of Religion then the inward motion of piety, ſince they can ſubſiſt without this inward motion, but not without the outward ſhew. I wonder that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd not this common maxime of the Schools.
<note n="a" place="margin">Bonum ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegra cauſa, malum antem ex minimo defectu.</note> 
                        <hi>To do good all the good conditions muſt concurre, but the leaſt defect is ſufficient unto evil.</hi> This perhaps might have kept him from concluding ſo ill, and he might have conſidered that there is more required to do good then to do ill, and to an action of Religion then to an action of Idolatry. And if to do good all conditions muſt concurre thereto, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2070"/> by much ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reaſon the intent which is the principal and as it were the ſoul of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſaith yet more then <hi>Bauny.</hi> For he maintains that it is not onely not neceſſary for ſatisfying the precept of reciting the office, to intend it: but alſo that it is neceſſarily ſatisfied in the recital; though the intention be expreſſe and formal not to ſatisfie it. For having demanded

                        <hi>Leſſius ſaith moreover that one is diſcharged of his Oath, though in doing what he ſwore to do, he have an expreſſe intent not to fulfil it.</hi> That is to ſay, that we may ſatisfie promiſes made unto God, with an oath in performing outwardly that which we have promiſed, though we have a formal will not to fulfil; but to elude it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſſius</hi> alledges for reaſon of this opinion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2080"/> that when God or the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us any thing, the action onely is commanded us, and not the intention. <hi>The reaſon is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe that which is commanded us is not, for example, to hear maſſe with intent to accompliſh the precept, but ſimply to attend the Maſſe with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and devotion; which is performed though it be done with deſign not to accompliſh the precept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that according to this marvellous Divinity we may hear the Maſſe with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and devotion, though we have a formal deſign not to obey the Church, and to deſpiſe its commandment.

                        <hi>Layman</hi> talks more openly, and more boldly then the reſt. He ſaith not onely, with them, that it is not needful that we have a will to obey the Church, in obſerving her commandments, and that we may do them though we contemn her in our heart: but alſo that we may accompliſh her commands by doing ontwardly that which ſhe command, though we have an intention directly oppoſite to hers.

                     <p>I know not what Father or Maſter would be content with ſuch obedience, and that would not take it rather for true diſobedience accompanied with contempt; and thereby much greater and more offenſive then if by ſimple negligence that had been omitted which was commanded.</p>

                     <p>But <hi>Layman</hi> after all this which we have above reported from him, concludes thus:
<note n="i" place="margin">
                           <hi>Quare cum opus quod prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur impleas, etſi per ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam vel errorem te non implere existimes, vel etiam nolis implere, non potes tamen efficere quoniam impleas: ſiquidem proteſtatio facta contraria vim nullam habet.</hi> Layman, ubr ſupra.</note> 
                        <hi>wherefore when you do that which is commanded, though by miſtake or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance you think you have not ſatisfied the precept, or that you had even a will not to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it at all, it need not hinder you from taking ſatisfaction in the effect: becauſe the proteſtation you made, that you did it not willingly, had no force.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He pretends then that a command of God or the Church is accompliſhed, not onely without any intention to do it; nor onely with intention not to do it; nor onely with an intention directly oppoſite to that of God and the Church; but alſo with an expreſſe proteſtation of being unwilling to ſatisfie it, and with a perſwaſion that it is not ſatisfied: that is to ſay, that we may ſerve God in deſpight of him and our ſelves; and be diſcharged of the obedience we owe God and the Church in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which he would not have us to do, and which we are not willing to do our ſelves, and which we believe is not ſufficient to obedience.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2110"/> This concluſion is without doubt very ſtrange but the principle from whence theſe Divines draw it, and the examples of which they make uſe to unfold and eſtabliſh it by, ſeem, it may be, no leſſe. For they ſay that as he who bends his knees before an Idol ceaſeth not to be an Idolater, though he proteſt he will be none; and he who ſmites a man without a cauſe ceaſeth not to be an offender, becauſe he proteſts he hath a contrary deſign: So he that doth that which God and the Church command him, fulfils the commandment, though he proteſt that he hath no will to fulfil it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the rare and marvellous reaſonings of theſe Divines, who ſeem to have undertaken to debaſe Chriſtians below the Jews, who honored God by outward means, and teſtified by words and viſible actions that they would obey him: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding God complains of them, and rejects their ſervices as of a treacherous and hypocritical people. In ſtead whereof theſe Doctors pretend that Chriſtians may ſatisfie the commands of God and the Church, not onely with a contrary intention; but alſo with a proteſtation that they will not obey, and not honouring God therein ſo much as with their lips onely, as the Jews to whom it ſerved for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of their treachery.</p>
                     <p>The foundation of all theſe concluſions is found in

For thus he expounds himſelf in the propoſition.</p>
                     <p>But this is to give no more unto God then to all reaſonable men, even to Pagans themſelves. For to will a thing becauſe it ſeems honeſt or reaſonable is to will that which <hi>Plato; Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> have willed, which is to be conformable to their will, and to all thoſe who ever made profeſſion of Philoſophie and vertue, even amongſt Pagans, becauſe they are all agreed in this general point, that they willed nothing, and that nothing ought to be willed, but for ſome reaſon which they judged good and honeſt, though they knew not one another, and their wills in particular were very different, and many times oppoſite to one another.</p>
                     <p>According to this rule one may pretend to be conformable to the will of God in the greateſt ſins, becauſe many times he is induced thereto by reaſons which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <pb n="87" facs="tcp:46318:62"/>good unto him, and which he believes to be honeſt; as thoſe who perſecuted the Apoſtles believed they did a thing well pleaſing unto God; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2130"/> and all thoſe who ſin by a falſe zeal, or by ignorance, and without malice.</p>

I wonder that theſe Doctors never had that in their minds, at leaſt, which our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſaid in the Goſpel,

It muſt needs be therefore that one of theſe two ways,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2160"/> which are not for God, ſhould be for the world. For there is but God and the World, the love of God and of the World, that can divide our heart and our life.</p>
                     <p>So that, according to this Doctrine, we may divide our hearts and lives betwixt God and the World, and do one part of our actions for the love of God, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part for the love of the World, and of our ſelves. Theſe two diſorders are in effect but one, and are both contained in this principle of <hi>Filliutius,</hi> of which we have ſpoken; That we are excuſed from conforming our whole will to that of God, in willing all that he wills and commands, and in willing it in ſuch manner as he wills it.</p>
                     <p>There is none who may not ſee how this principle overthrows the dependance which man ought to have upon God, at leaſt in that which concerns the inward part.

                     <p>If they would abſolutely part betwixt God and Man, they ſhould at leaſt make a more juſt and more reaſonable partition; attributing to God that which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the more noble, to wit, the heart and the intention, inſtead of giving it to man, and leaving unto God nothing properly but the outſide, as if he were not the God of the ſpirit, but onely of the body.</p>

                     <p>IT is one general maxime in the Divinity of the Jeſuits, that to ſin it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to do the evil that is forbidden, or not to do that which is commanded by the Law of God, Nature, or the Church: But it behoves alſo to have a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the evil that we do, and an intention to do it. By this rule they excuſe the greateſt ſins, under a pretence that they have a good intention in committing them, which commonly is but imaginary, or that we have no evil intention, though commonly we have ſo without knowing it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bauny</hi> makes uſe of this pretence of an imaginary good intention to juſtifie the hatred of our Neighbour, and the good averſion we have from him, ſo far as to wiſh him evil, and even death it ſelf. <hi>Bauny</hi> in his Summe, chap. 6. conc. 4. pag. 73. <hi>We may,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wiſh evil to our Neighbour without ſin, when we are induced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by ſome good motive.</hi> Which he endeavours to confirm by reaſon, and by the authority of the

<hi>exempts from all fault the Mother that deſires the death of her Daughters, becauſe for want of beauty or portion ſhe cannot match them according to her deſire, or perhaps becauſe by occaſion of them ſhe is ill treated by her Husband, or injured. For ſhe doth not properly deteſt her Daughters through diſlike of them, but from an abhorrence to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46318:63"/>her own evils.</hi> The good intention which induces this Mother to deſire the death of her Daughters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2280"/> is no other thing then ambition, and a deſire to marry them more advantagiouſly then ſhe is able; or her impatience which permits her not to bear the evil uſage and injuries of her Husband, which ſeem unto her more unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable then the death of her own children: Nevertheleſſe a good intention of this ſort is ſufficient, with <hi>Bauny, to excuſe from all fault this Mother who deſires the death of her Daughters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no crime in which we may not find ſuch like good intention; and by conſequence which may not be excuſed by this reaſon. For this cauſe he proceeds and ſaith, <hi>that he who ſhould maintain an heretical propoſition without believing it, who ſhould be a communicant or Auditor (amongſt the Hugenots) without having his heart there, but out of pure deriſion, or to comply with the times, and to accompliſh his deſigns, he ought not to be eſteemed an Hugenot therefore, becauſe his underſtanding is not infected with errour.</hi> So that, not only ordinary crimes, but hereſie it ſelf and Apoſtacy, and all ſorts of impieties, may be excuſed by the ſecret intention of the Jeſuits School; and we may do all theſe things without being heretiques or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.</p>
                     <p>If he had not a priviledge to propound things quite contrary when he pleaſeth, we might repreſent unto him that what he ſaith here, accords not with what he ſaid above; that he who bows his knee before an Image is an Idolater, though he have no deſign to adore the Idol, and onely feignes to do it. But it was neceſſary he ſhould ſpeak ſo in this place, where the queſtion was how to prove that we might fulfil the commands of God and the Church, in doing outwardly that which they command,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2290"/> though we intended it not: and here where he is in hand to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that to ſin and to make a man guilty of the tranſgreſſion of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God and the Church, it is not ſufficient to violate them indeed, if he have not an intention and deſign for it, it was neceſſary for him to ſpeak in an other manner quite oppoſite to the firſt.</p>
                     <p>A contradiction ſo formal and manifeſt in a ſubject ſo important to Faith and Religion, as well as to manners, will hardly find ſhelter under the vail and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a good intention, how ſpecious ſoever it may be; and it is certain that at the bottom it could not proceed from any but the Father of lyes and errours, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of which he ſeems to have undertaken to ſpeak, as well as of the libertines and profane. For he and his Fraternity who are in the ſame opinion with him, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that we may accompliſh the commands of God and the Church, without any inward will, and his opinion is that we cannot fulfil thoſe of the Devil in violating the commandments of God and the Church, if we have not a deſign in our hearts thereto. So that the Devil muſt be ſerved more ſincerely then God and the Church, and he hath more power and more right upon the inward actions and hearts of men then God and the Church have. For he pretends, with other Divines of the Society, that the Church hath no power over the inward motions of our ſouls, and that the commands of God are not extended ſo far as them, and comprize not the intention nor manner in which God wills they ſhould be fulfilled and executed.</p>
                     <p>But if he who propounds theſe heretical propoſitions and publiquely perpetrates theſe heretical actions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2200"/> ought not to paſſe for an Heretique, becauſe he believes not that he ſaith and doth amongſt the Heretiques; neither ought he be accounted a Catholick, becauſe he makes not profeſſion of that he believes internally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Catholicks; but rather makes a contrary profeſſion. He is therefore, to ſpeak properly, neither Catholick nor Heretick. But he is worſe then an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. He is a time-ſerver, a man of no Religion, who derides both Hereticks and Catholicks, complying with both, <hi>for the better mannaging his affairs,</hi> as <hi>Bauny</hi> ſpeaks, and taking up Religion onely as a matter of merryment. See here the motives and the good intentions whereby he excuſes their crime who maintain He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical propoſitions, or receive the Supper with the Hugenots, without having their hearts ingaged thereto.</p>

<note n="k" place="margin">ut nullatenus cum ad ſui amorem provocare intendat.</note> but <hi>that ſhe have no intention</hi> to cauſe him to ſin who loves her.

                     <p>So that although this woman knows that ſhe is about to deſtroy a man by an action which is altogether free, and which ſhe may eaſily eſchew, ſhe ſhall not be at all guilty for his death, according to the Jeſuits, if ſhe had not a formal deſign to kill him.

                     <p>The principle of all this Doctrine concerning ſcandal, may be ſeen in <hi>Bauny,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2260"/> in the 39. chap. of his Summe, pag. 623. where treating of this matter purpoſely, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: <hi>Whether he who doth ſome thing from which his action he foreſees that others will take matter of offence and ſin, ought to accuſe himſelf thereof; and what is this ſin to be termed?</hi> He ſaith frankly, that <hi>Navarre,</hi> and others whom he cites, <hi>ſay that it is ſcandal:</hi> But he adds in his following diſcourſe: <hi>This is not my judgement. See upon what I build. Taking ſcandal properly and for one ſpecial kind of ſin, ſuch an one is not guilty thereof, ſave onely when by a formal deſign he ſaith or doth ſome thing for the ghoſtly deſtruction of his Neighbours.</hi> This is the general principle upon which his Fraternity build, as well as he, the foundation of all this matter.</p>
                     <p>He muſt be utterly forſaken of God, and in the extremity of black and affected malice who falls into this exceſſe, and into this ſort of hatred of his Neighbour, which is proper onely unto Devils; and to reduce the ſin of ſcandal to this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to declare that it is committed no where but in Hell, and to take it quite out of the world; or rather it is to entertain and protect it in the world, by diſguiſing it in ſuch ſort as that we may not know when we commit it; and by conſequence to give all men licence to commit it freely, and without ſcruple,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2270"/> in making them believe that they commit it not in doing theſe actions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bauny</hi> alſo makes uſe of the pretence of a good intention, to juſtifie Uſury. For after he had furniſhed us with an invention, to palliate and cover it before the eyes of men, by means of three contracts, of which he himſelf preſcribes us the form, he endeavours to hide it from God himſelf if he could, and alſo to juſtifie it by a good intention. <hi>For greater ſurety,</hi> (ſaith he, in the 14. chap. of his Summe, p. 219.) <hi>it is good that the creditour ſay to him that is his debtor, that his intention in this contract is not uſurarious, though he let out his money to him for profit, with protestation on his part that he would do nothing therein against God and his conſcience. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he declares that he is determined onely to that which is good and far off from ſin.</hi> Thus he mocks God and Man, intending to ſurprize them by ſuch groſſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; as if he could change the nature of things by innevating the turms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſing them.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſie to ſee the contradiction which is in theſe words; but it will appear yet more clearly, if we compare that which he ſaith here with what he tells us elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in his practique, l. 3. chap. 6. pag.
362. where treating of benefices, he ſaith, <hi>when any one cauſeth a benefice with cure incompatible with a dignity to be provided for him, he is reputed to renounce it without any expreſſion thereof in words, c.</hi> 1.
<hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. in</hi> 6. <hi>although he make proteſtation that he will not part with it; becauſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation is contrary to his action.</hi> A man that is in a dignity and who cauſes a cure alſo to be provided for him, cannot hold them both, although he would, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth that it is his intention; <hi>becauſe this proteſtation is contrary to his action.</hi> And an Uſurer who gives his money to intereſt <hi>to make profit thereof,</hi> may deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from uſury and reſtitution,
<hi>by proteſting that it is not his intention to make an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious contract,</hi> though in very deed he do make one, <hi>and his proteſtation be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his action.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of the greateſt abuſes that theſe Doctors make of the intention, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2280"/> is in the uſe of the Sacraments, and particularly of that of penance. When a man is altogether overwhelmed with crimes, which he often doth reiterate, and into which he doth fall many times, they pretend that he needs but a moment to reduce himſelf into good terms with God, and that one onely word uttered with his lips or drawn thence by a Confeſſor, will ſuffice to make ſo great a change: and provided he ſay he will mend, and promiſe it unto the Prieſt, he ſhall be obliged to repoſe himſelf upon this pretended good intention, and upon this promiſe, <hi>although it may be preſumed for the moſt part that ſuch reſolutions proceed onely fro the lips,</hi> as <hi>Bauny</hi> confeſſeth in his Summe, chap. 46 pag. 717. of which he brings a good proof, and as it were a certain mark, in theſe follwing words: <hi>As it will come to paſſe, if notwithſtanding all this which theſe people have ſaid and promiſed for the time paſt to the ſaid Confeſſor, <pb n="93" facs="tcp:46318:65"/>they do not ceaſe to behave themſelves with greater exceſſe and liberty in thoſe crimes then before.</hi> And though alſo we ſee by experience of what is paſt, that they will not amend, and that their preſent diſpoſition makes it alſo ſufficiently appear that they have no true will, he forbears not to maintain <hi>that we muſt believe what they ſay, cum ipſi ſint ſui accuſatores, defenſore, &amp; testes; being they are their own accuſors, defenders and witneſſes; though many times it may be preſumed that ſuch reſolutions come not from beyond their lips.</hi> Such are the moſt part of the reſolutions, promiſes, good intentions of the greateſt ſinners, upon which notwithſtanding theſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ground themſelves to conferre on hem the Sacraments,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2290"/> though they themſelves judge them unworthy; and to juſtifie the greateſt crimes, and which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who commit them, durſt not at all take upon them to defend, if theſe Doctors did not maintain and aſſure them falſely by this pretended good intention, which they teach them to form in a moment, and by one onely word, in ſaying onely that they have, or that they would have it.</p>
                     <p>In which they are ſo ingenious, that when they cannot find this ſort of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in him who hath done amiſſe, they go to ſeek it without him in ſome other acceſſary to the action. As if that would ſuffice to clear it of malice and crime. Thus <hi>Bauny</hi> exempts from mortal ſin, children who rob their parents; <hi>In as much,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as the Parents cannot be ſuppoſed to be willing to oblige their children not to meddle with what is theirs upon this penalty; there being good reaſon to believe that they had rather ſee all their goods waſted by their hands, then their ſaid children out of grace and favour with God.</hi> As if the commandments of God and the ſin of thoſe who violate them, depended on the diſpoſition or will of man; and as if thoſe who were offended together with God in the ſame action which was committed againſt him and againſt his Law, by releaſing their intereſt; and remitting the fault which is committed againſt them, could alſo as ſpeedily take away and blot out that which is againſt God and againſt his Law, principally when he that hath committed it doth not take the pains to ask him pardon,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2300"/> nor to give him ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>If it be true, as ſaith <hi>Bauny,</hi> that children ſin not mortally in taking the goods of their Fathers and Mothers; why ſay they not alſo that they ſhould not ſin mortally in attempting their lives alſo? For the reaſon they bring for the one proves it as well of the other. His reaſon is that <hi>parents cannot be thought to oblige their children, not to attempt upon what is theirs under this pain</hi> of mortal ſin, and eternal damnation; and we may as well believe that they are not to be thought to deſire to oblige them not to enterprize upon their lives on the ſame pain, it being apparent that if Fathers were true Chriſtians, as they ſuppoſe them to be, they would rather like to ſee not onely all their goods waſted by their childrens hands, but their own lives loſt alſo, rather then ſee their children in diſgrace with God, or in eternal pains.</p>
                     <p>By this ſame reaſon, by which they go about to excuſe the theft of children, it will follow that the wicked perſecuting honeſt men; Tyrants ſpilling the blood of Martyrs, the Jews in putting to death Jeſus Chriſt, ſinned not mortally; becauſe it is certain that neither Jeſus Chriſt, nor the Martyrs, nor honeſt men ever had an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that thoſe who invaded their goods, their honor, or their lives, ſhould fall into diſpleaſure with God, or into eternal damnation. On the contrary there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that they would not do and ſuffer to hinder them there from, as may be ſeen clearly in that the Saints and Martyrs prayed unto God to pardon them that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them, following herein the example of Jeſus Chriſt, who prayed upon the Croſſe for thoſe who put him to death, and demanded of his Father that he would not impute unto them the ſin of his death.</p>

                        <hi>That the Jeſuits enhanſe and debaſe as they pleaſe the goods of this world, which are the uſual object or matter of ſin; and ſo nouriſh vice, and diſpenſe with the Law of God.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe object and the matter of ſin are temporal things, which God having made for man that he might imploy them for his ſervice, he turns them into a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, by taking occaſion of offending and deſtroying himſelf thereby, by ſuffering himſelf to be ſurprized by the pleaſure which he finds therein, or making uſe of them otherwiſe then God hath ordained.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuits are wont to judge of ſin by its object, and to meaſure its greatneſs by the quantity of the matter, and by the value of the things which induce men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. I will not examine this principle, the defect whereof is eaſie to be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But I am confident, that there is none that will not finde it very ſtrange, that they having eſtabliſhed this rule, which ought by conſequence be always inviolable amongſt them, they yet do not follow it themſelves, but do like thoſe who have two different weights and meaſures; ſetting what price they pleaſe upon temporal goods, making them ſometimes much and ſometimes little worth,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2320"/> according to the divers deſigns they have to gratifie the paſſions and luſts of men. They debaſe worldly goods to excuſe the ſins of thoſe who uſurpe them unjuſtly; and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanſe their price and repreſent them as very conſiderable, for to diſpenſe with the Law of God, when we cannot obſerve it without ſuffering ſome loſſe and ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution in theſe very goods.</p>
                     <p>It is upon theſe principles, and with this ſpirit, that
<hi>Bauny</hi> in his Summe, chap. 7. pag. 80. after he had deſcribed envie as a monſtrous vice, <hi>which ſits,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>like the Cantharides onely on the faireſt flowers,</hi> after he had ſaid with Saint
<hi>Cyprian, that it is as it were the worm of the ſoul, which makes its own hurt of anothers good;</hi> and after he had declared univerſally, that
<hi>the envious man engaged not a little his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and honour, ſince againſt all ſorts of prudence, by a Metamorphoſis altogether vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, he attempts to change good into evil, and good and wholeſome actions into poiſon;</hi> nevertheleſs he concludes in this ſort: <hi>this ſin, though Saint</hi> Auguſtin <hi>teſtifies that it is contrary unto charity, nevertheleſs ſeems not to me to be mortal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although envie be ſo pernicious and deformed as he repreſents it; though it <hi>be like the worm that conſumes the ſoul</hi> and ruines the conſcience; <hi>like venim</hi> which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts good actions and <hi>turns good into ill; though it be contrary unto charity, as Saine</hi> Cyprian <hi>and Saint</hi> Auguſtin <hi>ſay,</hi> and as he himſelf avows with them, <hi>yet it ſeems not to him that it is a mortal ſin;</hi> and if we will believe him, it ought not be put into the number of the ſeven mortal ſins. His reaſon is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1330"/>
                        <hi>becauſe the good which is found in temporal things is ſo ſlender, and of ſo little conſequence in reſpect of Heaven, that it is of no conſideration with God and his Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the ſame reaſon we may ſay that theft, ſlander, and even homicide it ſelf are no mortal ſins; becauſe that the goods which are withheld from our Neighbour by theft, the honour we violate by ſlander, and his very life which we cauſe him loſe by homicide, <hi>are all temporals, in which the good that is found is ſo ſmall and of ſo little conſequence in reſpect to Heaven, that it is of no conſideration with God and his Saints:</hi> and by conſequence could not be matter of mortal ſin according to the Divinity of this Father, nor a ſufficient ſubject to put man out of favour with God. See here how this Author debaſes the price and eſtimation of temporal goods to excuſe ſin, But when he hath in hand to diſpenſe with men for their duty, and the Law of God; then he enhanſeth their price, to cauſe that luſt may prevail with us above the Law of God on thoſe occaſions, wherein to obey and keep it we muſt ſuffer ſome loſſe in theſe goods.</p>

                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:46318:66"/>In the 46. Chap. of his Summe, pag. 711, after he had eſtabliſhed the conditions neceſſary to a penitent to be in an eſtate to receive abſolution, he propoſes many queſtions, whereof ſee here the firſt: <hi>From theſe principles,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it will be eaſie to anſwer the queſtions which follow: The firſt, thoſe who in their commerce, their traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, their diſcourſe, their reſort, are obliged to ſee, to ſpeak, to treat with maidens and women,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1340"/> whoſe ſight and meeting makes them oftentimes fall into ſin; If they; I ſay, are capable in this perpetual danger, of being in grace and receiving abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſaw well enough that this paſſe was dangerous, and that the anſwer he was about to make to this queſtion was of it ſelf odious and ſcandalous: For this reaſon he cauſes to march in his front a good number of Authors, as it were to ſound the ford, and to be his guarde. The firſt he produces is de <hi>Baia,</hi> whom he makes mouth to them all, and to anſwer abſolutely, <hi>yea.</hi> He alledges <hi>Navarre</hi> after, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to confirm this opinion, and to aſſure us that <hi>we may not conſtrain this penitent to abandon that traffick which is ſo perillous unto him.</hi> He puts <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> laſt, ſaying that he declareth
<hi>that upon the penitents refuſal to quit his traffique, we may not refuſe him abſolution; provided that he and thoſe others with whom he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſin found their refuſal upon ſome good and lawful cauſe; as not to be able to dispenſe therewith without giving the world ſubject to talk of, or that they themſelve ſhould thence receive ſome inconvenience. For otherwiſe, ſay they,</hi> (he ſpeaks of others whom he cited) <hi>we cannot refuſe them abſolution, dummodo firmiter proponant, ſo that they ſtrongly inſiſt on it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After theſe Authors he is more confident, and ſpeaks with more aſſurance, p. 712. ſaying, that though the occaſion of ſin
<hi>be as it were certain, nevertheleſſe becauſe it is not affected nor ſought out in a frolick, and without neceſſity, becauſe we cannot avoid the dangers that are joyned thereunto, without ſcandal, without concerning therein our honours and our goods, it follows that to perſevere therein is no fault, by the fourth rule of right, quod non eſt licitum in lege, neceſſitas facit licitum, what is not lawful by law, is made lawful by neceſſity.</hi>

                        <hi>That though God as a Soveraign and abſolute Lord might make him ſuffer an eternal pain, who did diſobey him in a ſlight matter, yet he could not do it as a Judge, becauſe in this quality he is obliged to proportion the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the fault which is not greater then the matter of the diſobedience.</hi> That is to ſay in more clear terms, that God may make uſe of his abſolute power to do unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it being clear that he who makes uſe of his power without regard of Juſtice, commits unjuſtice; and if men cannot do in this manner, God can do it leſſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his power is much more ſtrongly and inſeperably united to his Juſtice then that of men. For it is founded upon Juſtice, and Juſtice is the foundation of his Throne, as the Scripture ſaith.

So that inſtead of concluding that it might be ſeparate from his Juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is great and Soveraign, the contrary ſhould rather be concluded, it being manifeſt that it would not be ſo great,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2450"/> nor ſo ſoveraign and Infinite as it is, if it were not inſeparable from his Juſtice, ſince to be ſevered from Juſtice is not true power, but an impuiſſance, a feebleneſs and a defect, which by conſequence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attributed to a Soveraign great and infinite power.</p>
                     <p>Alſo to ſay as <hi>Amicus</hi> ſaith here, that God can puniſh the faults of his creatures, otherwiſe then in the quality of a Judge, is to teſtifie that he may act without judgement, and not onely without cogniſance of the cauſe; but againſt the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and light of the truth: and by conſequence to deſpiſe or neglect truth and Juſtice, ſince it is no other then to deſpiſe it, not to conſider it when it is known.</p>
                     <p>This is finally to make God like thoſe wicked ones, who ſay in the Scripture: Our power ſhall be the Law of our Juſtice:
<hi>Sap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Sit autem fortitudo noſtra lex Juſtitiae.</hi> Which is proper onely to violence and Tyranny, it belonging to none but Tyrants to meaſure their Juſtice by their power, and not to be willing that their power ſhould be regulated by Juſtice. This is then to overturn the power of God, and to ruine it utterly to conceive of it in this manner, as theſe new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines repreſent it, this is to deprive him of his Soveraignity and infinite greatneſs, and to render it defective and like that of the Creatures. Alſo theſe people regard not the intereſt of God, whileſt they advance his authority in a manner ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him; but the upholding of their maximes, and the falſe reputation of their Schools. Whence it comes that when the ſame intereſt of their Schools and of their Doctrine requires it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2460"/> they abaſe the ſame power of God as unworthily as here they elevate it; as ſhall clearly appear in the ſubject we handle.</p>
                     <p>For on one ſide they take from God the true power, which he hath to command all things great and little, ſo abſolutely that we cannot diſobey them without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mortally, and without encurring an obligation to an eternal puniſhment: becauſe this is not accommodable to the principle which they have eſtabliſhed, whereby to judge of ſin, by meaſuring its greatneſs by its matter; and on
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand they attribute unto God the power which he hath not, and which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have, to torment without ſin, and without any cauſe an innocent perſon, and to make him even ſuffer eternal pains for his pleaſure alone, and by his abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe it is the ſequel of the ſame principle, and for to defend it and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the difficulties and inconveniencies it draws after it, it is neceſſary that they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this ſecond maxime: that is to ſay, that to defend an errour and impiety, they are forced to advance another greater then the former.</p>
                     <p>For this is the property of errour, to grow always as it advances, and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy and the exceſſes thereof are commonly greater and more viſible in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and concluſions, then in its beginnings and principles, whence they are drawn. Without doubt the Jeſuits would abhorre theſe impieties, and many other which they promote, if they looked on them alone and in themſelves; but when they ſee them to be the neceſſary conſequences of their Doctrine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2470"/> they believe themſelves engaged in honour to maintain and confirm them rather then to recal <pb n="100" facs="tcp:46318:69"/>and correct their opinions. Such is the carriage of <hi>Amicus,</hi> when he repeats this the ſecond time, and anſwers with aſſurance that

                     <p>So that to cover in ſome manner an injuſtice ſo manifeſt, he makes uſe of a marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſubtilty, ſaying that damnation and eternal puniſhment, which God cauſes an innocent perſon to ſuffer, or him who is guilty of venial ſins onely, ſhall not be a penalty but an affliction and a torment.

                        <hi>This pain,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſo far as it exceeds his fault, ſhall not be due unto him.</hi> Whence he draws this concluſion:
<hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not hold the place of a puniſhment, becauſe puniſhment is related to a fault as a propriety proportionable thereto.</hi> And that which he adjoyns: <hi>That it will be rather a torment, which God as Soveraign Lord may cauſe every creature to ſuffer though most innocent;</hi> ſerves onely to make more appear the injuſtice he attributes unto God. For the word <hi>torment</hi> is more harſh, and more odious then that of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe pain cannot be called torment, but when it is extreme and unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. So that if it be unjuſt to puniſh an innocent, it is alſo more to torment him.</p>
                     <p>And if God by his will alone may torment an innocent, it ſhall be no more true which the holy Scriptures teach us, that God takes from himſelf onely the motive to do us good, and from our ſelves onely the ſubject to do us ill; becauſe both the one and the other ſhall come of his own will alone; and even herein he ſhall be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Author of evil, and the greateſt evil which a reaſonable creature can ſuffer, which are the torments and eternal pains of Hell, if he make him ſuffer them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having offended him, or for having committed onely ſome ſmall fault; which is againſt the univerſal conſent of the holy Fathers, againſt the Faith of the Church, and againſt natural right and equity.</p>
                     <p>So the ſubtilty of this Author inſtead of mollifying his opinion and juſtifying it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2490"/> hath made it yet more unworthy of God and unmaintainable, and teaches us no other thing then that after we are fallen from errour into impiety, to maintain both obſtinately, we fall eaſily into blindneſs and extravagance, renouncing reaſon it ſelf, and the common ſenſe of all men, to follow vain imaginations and trivial and groundleſs ſubtleties.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond concluſion which we ſaid the Jeſuits draw from this principle: That the greatneſs of a ſin ought to be taken from its matter and object, is this, that he who hath a will and a deſign to commit if he could all venial ſins, ſinneth onely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially, <hi>Eſcobar</hi> makes thereof a probleme; propoſing it in this manner.

<note n="m" place="margin">Non peccat, quia malitia interni actus voluntat is deſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur ab objecto, prout propenitur à ratione.

                     </p>
                     <p>So that a man may have a will to commit all the venial ſins which he can commit in the matter of theft; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2502"/> and all thoſe which can be committed by intemperance; and by all other vices, without ſinning otherwiſe then venially; that is to ſay, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mortal ſin we may have a will to ſteal all the goods of the world if we could, taking it at many times, and every time in ſmall quantity, which according to this rule of theſe Caſuiſts, could not be matter ſufficient for a mortal ſin; and ſo in the other vices and ſins.

                     <p>If a child ſhould deal thus with his Father, or a friend with his friend, or a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant with his Maſter, he would make himſelf an object of publick hate, and an abomination to the whole world; and there would be no perſon who would not judge them entirely unworthy of the quality and name of a Son, friend or ſervant.

He asks what judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be made of a Frier who ſhould be in ſuch an eſtate? whether his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and will which he hath abſolutely to violate all the points of his rule, and all the duties of his profeſſion wherein he believed he ſhould not ſin at all, or but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially, <pb n="102" facs="tcp:46318:70"/>ſhould be a mortal ſin? whether this would hinder him from being a good Monk, and whether this would be a great fault againſt the obligation which he had to move towards perfection?</p>
                     <p>The anſwer of this Doctor is, that ſuch a man ceaſed not for all that to be in a good eſtate before God; and that he ſhould be a good Frier though not perfect, and that he ſinned not, at leaſt not mortally, againſt the obligation he had in the quality of a Religious perſon to purſue after perfection. One of his reaſons is, that becauſe he ſins but venially (as he ſuppoſes) in violating ſeverally every one of the points of his rule, and the regular obſervations which he is reſolved not to obſerve, the will which he hath to tranſgreſſe them all, is but a will to ſin venially, and which hath for its object venial ſins onely; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2530"/> and which by conſequence it ſelf could be no other then a venial ſin.</p>

This were to transform men into Beaſts, and to ſubject them to follow their ſenſes in the regulation of their life, and to treat Chriſtians like Heathens, to give them no other rule for their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and actions, then the maximes of Philoſophie and humane reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Yet this is it which the Jeſuits have done; and all thoſe who read their Divinity, and principally that which treats of manners, will find therein no other principles in a manner but thoſe of the loweſt Philoſophie and humane reaſon, and that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They hardly know what it is to cite Scripture or Councils, and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe any paſſages of the Holy Fathers, it is for the moſt part for form onely or to reſute them, rather then to uſe them for foundations or ſolid proofs of their opinions, in relying on the authority of theſe great men who have advanced nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in points of conſequence, which belong to Faith or manners, which they had <pb n="104" facs="tcp:46318:71"/>not taken from thoſe who went before them in the Church, and which came not originally from the Apoſtles, and from Jeſus Chriſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2560"/> by the Tradition of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But the Jeſuits, far enough from this conduct, make profeſſion to invent and to ſpeak things of themſelves, to follow novelty, to make every thing probable, to leave to the ingenious to chooſe in all opinions.

                        <hi>Divine Traditions are thoſe which the Apoſtles have learned from the mouth of Jeſus Chriſt, or which the Holy Ghoſt hath dictated, and they have written by his Command, or by that of Jeſus Chriſt.

                     <p>If it be true, as he faith, that the Apoſtles have made theſe rules in the Church, whether concerning faith or manners, and that they have not received them from Jeſus Chriſt nor the Holy Ghoſt, he hath reaſon to ſay that the conſtitutions and traditions, which he terms Apoſtolical, are onely of humane right, becauſe they take their original and their authority from the ſpirit of man, and which by conſequence may be changed by men; and it may follow alſo from the ſame principle, that they are ſubject unto errour; the ſpirit of a man, how holy ſoever it be, may always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, when he is the Author and original of his thoughts and actions.</p>
                     <p>It will follow thence alſo that the Apoſtles have governed the Church as Princes, and Politicians govern their eſtates and their common wealths, by their wit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It would follow likewiſe that the Church is not governed by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2660"/> being they who firſt governed it, and who are the firſt modules to all them that followed in that rule, had no other then an humane conduct, in inſtituting and eſtabliſhing of themſelves that which ſeemed unto them juſt and reaſonable; not as inſtruments animated by Jeſus Chriſt, but as the Authors and principals thereof, following their own ſences and thoughts.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuits perhaps will not be much troubled to agree to all thoſe thing; which are <pb n="108" facs="tcp:46318:73"/>common enough in their Society, and maintained by their moſt famous Writers, who teach that the Laws of the Church are no other then humane; that its power and conduct extends onely to the outward man, and that the Church it ſelf is onely a politick body, as ſhall be proved elſewhere, when we come to make known how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious theſe maximes are to all Religion, and overturn the power and authority of the Church.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Azor</hi> had ſpoken ſo baſely and ſo unworthily of the Apoſtles and Apoſtolical conſtitutions, we need not think that ſtrange which he ſaith againſt the Ancients and Fathers of the Church, and would have the opinions of the new writers of theſe times to have as much weight and credit as they, ſo that if the Fathers ſometimes prevail with them againſt the new Authors, the new Authors do as often and more frequently prevail over the Fathers. It is in the ſecond Book of his Moral Inſtitutions, where after he had demanded

                        <hi>when the opinions are equal themſelves, thoſe of the ancients are commonly preferred before new writers: but there is neither law nor reaſon ſufficient to oblige us to preferre them always.</hi> This is no great honour to the Fathers, to ſay that we may preferre their opinions before thoſe of modern Authors, when the reaſons appear equal on both ſides,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2670"/> ſince as much may be ſaid of all ſorts of Writers, following the Jeſuits rule of probability.</p>
                     <p>But the contempt is more manifeſt in that which he adds, that even in this caſe there is no obligation to ſubject our judgements to the opinions of the Holy Doctors of the Church, who in important affairs ſay nothing but what they learned of it, and that every one hath liberty to follow them, or not to follow them; ſo it ſhall be lawful to follow the moderns always, and never to follow the Fathers, when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the moderns are as likely as thoſe of the Fathers, which will eaſily appear ſo to thoſe who judge by humane ſenſe, and natural reaſon, rather then by the light of Faith, as the Caſuiſts of theſe times, and the people of the world commonly do.</p>
                     <p>It will alſo be lawful to preferre the moderns before the Ancients, even when the ancients are grounded on more ſtrong and ſolid reaſons, according to that maxime of the Jeſuits, who ſay that we may prefer an opinion, which is leſſe, before another which is more probable. For this is an infallible conſequence of this maxime, joyned to that other, which will have the Fathers, and their opinions, conſidered no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by reaſon and conformity to humane ſenſe, as the Parliament of
<hi>Paris</hi> conſiders the Laws and opinions of the ancient Roman Lawyers; or rather as the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks conſider the holy Fathers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2680"/> to whom even they render a little more honour and reſpect in appearance: ſaying that they are to be judged, not by reaſon, as all theſe new Doctors, but by the Scriptures, though they regard not Scripture but according to their reaſon, and the preoccupation of their ſpirits. But they both agree in the over throw they give the authority of the Fathers, ſubjecting them to their reaſon and their fancy, and giving them onely as much force as they pleaſe, following the cuſtom of all thoſe who impugn the truths, and moſt aſſured and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable rules of antiquity and Religion.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is ordinary with thoſe who have no right to a thing, for which they conteſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, to endeavour to have it divided, to the end that they may have at leaſt one half, when they cannot carry all for themſelves.

                     <p>But if it belong to the ancients to determine on queſtions which ariſe about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, it muſt needs be that they alſo decide difficult matters of conſcience and manners, ſince the faithful ought to live by Faith; and if we ought to take from the moderns the rules of manners, and not of faith, we muſt have another rule of life given us then faith, if faith be not the ſource and meaſure of good works, nor the principle of Chriſtian life.</p>

                     <p>If it be true then that we ought to take the ancients for the rule of faith onely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2700"/> and not of works, the faith which we receive from them will be dead and barren; and if the moderns give us onely the rules of manners, without thoſe of Faith, our life, how good ſoever it appear, would be no other then Heathen. And if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that with the rules of manners they give us alſo them of faith, whether they take them from the ancients, or make them themſelves as they do thoſe of manners to give them us, we are more obliged to them then the ancients, or rather we hold all of them, without having any need of the ancients, we receive good life, vertue, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from thoſe who are no Saints, and we hold nothing from the Saints, from whom we receive onely a dead faith, a Faith of Devils as Saint

Whence it follows, we are no more to conſider the ancient Fathers, then as children, in regard of the moderns, who muſt be the venerable Fathers of the Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and by conſequence they can be no longer their diſciples, ſince it belongs to perfect men to inſtruct children, and not children to inſtruct men.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems that it is in this ſame ſence, that
<hi>Celot</hi> ſpeaking of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the firſt Eremite, of Saint

                           <p>There is no appearance that the Jeſuits would make uſe of this doctrine in their temporal affairs.

                              <hi>in things which have reference to the Salvation of the ſoul, a man ſhall ſin grievouſty in this, onely that be preferres that which is uncertain before that which is certain.</hi> And by the ſame rule that which is leſs certain, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2840"/> before that which is more. For that which is leſs certain, is uncertain in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that which is more; and the intention of this great Saint as well as of all the reſt, is to teach us that when eternal Salvation is concerned, we ought always to take the moſt certain ways, and that we cannot take too much ſecurity in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great importance: <hi>Nulla ſatis magna ſecuritas ubi periclitatur aeternit as.

                           </p>
                           <p>Finally, this prudence is not ſo much as humane and reaſonable; and we ſhould not approve of it in the conduct of temporal affairs. For if a Phyſitian give unto his patient of two remedies which he hath, the more uncertain and ineffectual: or if a Conſellor in his inſtructions about a ſuite, or in a Plea of great concernment ſhould make uſe of evidences and arguments which were more doubtful, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the more certain for any private intereſt: if an Overſeer or a Tutor who hath money to put out, ſhould not lend it him whom he knew to be the moſt ſure and ſolvent: If all theſe perſons, I ſay, acted on this manner, would they be eſteemed wiſe, or could we ſay they acted prudently; or ſhould we have cauſe to approve or be content with their conduct? It is probable the Jeſuits would not make uſe of ſuch people, nor imploy them in their affairs of importance; they are onely the things of God and of Salvation, wherein they find it good for us to act on this manner, and wherein they believe that it is not to act againſt true prudence.</p>

                              <hi>It follows</hi> 1. <hi>that we call that opinion probable; that is fupported by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſufficiently conſiderable, provided notwithſtanding there be no convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the contrary opinion, of ſuch ſort as we cannot, nor believe any other can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He requires then two conditions to make an opinion probable. <hi>That it be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on reaſons in ſome ſort conſiderable.</hi> Which will be eaſie enough to meet with, there being no perſon who having formed an opinion, doth not believe but that the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46318:79"/>reaſon he brings to ſuſtain it, is good and often better then that of thoſe who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the contrary.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond condition is,
<note n="d" place="margin">Ut pro oppoſito nulla fit ratio convincens.</note> 
                              <hi>that there be no convincing reaſon for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> This condition is no leſſe eaſie then the former. For a reaſon may be convincing in reſpect of one man, which is not ſo unto another, and he who favours an opinion may find it good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2990"/> when he who is of a contrary opinion may think it weak, and an obſtinate perſon will not ſuffer himſelf to be convinced by one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and at worſt he may eaſily perſwade himſelf, that when he cannot anſwer ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly the reaſons of his adverſaries, ſome other more learned then he may do it. This is that <hi>Tambourin</hi> affirms, upon the Decalogue.</p>
                           <p>So that by theſe two conditions all ſorts of opinions are eaſily made probable. For on one ſide thoſe which of themſelves have neither probability nor truth, nay become probable, if we can find any plauſible reaſon to ſuſtain them; and on the other ſide, a propoſition moſt aſſured and beſt eſtabliſhed by Tradition, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, and faith it ſelf, will become onely probable conſidered by humane reaſon, which is this Jeſuits rule to diſcern of probable opinions. For what reaſon ſo ever you can bring to prove it, they who know the evaſions of the Schools may elude it by ſome diſtinction, or imagine that it may be eluded by ſome other, and ſo it ſhall not be convincing; and by conſequence the propoſition ſhall be onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable by the definition of the Jeſuits.</p>

                              <hi>Becauſe an opinion establiſhed upon ſome foundation that is not ſleight, is probable.

                           <p>So that when <hi>P.

                           <p>For they hold that though a Doctor or Regent ſhould be deceived by publiſhing errours for truths, we may always in conſcience follow his opinion, even when he erreth againſt Divine right.

                              <hi>that there is great difference betwixt him that exerciſes outward juſtice, and he who exerciſes the inward: becauſe the firſt is judge between the parties, and is eſtabliſhed by the commonwealth to judge that which he believes to be moſt reaſonable; but the ſecond is a Judge at the tribunal of penance, to judge, as a Phyſitian, not betwixt parties, but betwixt Man and God.</hi> All this is more proper to deſtroy his opinion then to confirm it. For if a Judge who renders Juſtice before men, be obliged to follow that which he believes to be more equitable, how much more is a Confeſſer and judge of conſciences, who ought to follow juſtice and verity with ſo much more care and exactneſs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3130"/> becauſe the good of conſciences and ſalvation of ſouls is without compariſon more important, and ought to be more religiouſly preſerved then all outward things: if the tribunal of men require ſo perfect Juſtice, how much more perfect ought that to be of the tribunal of conſcience, which is the tribunal of God himſelf, where the Prieſt judges as holding the place of God and of Jesus Chriſt, who is juſtice and truth it ſelf. But if we conſider him in the quality of a Phyſitian as doth <hi>Sanchez,</hi> this quality it ſelf obliges us by his proper principles to follow the opinions that are more ſafe and more united unto truth, ſince he avows that Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are obliged always to embrace this ſort of opinions, and to forſake the leſs probable and more uncertain.</p>
                           <p>Finally, if humane Judges be obliged to ſearch out and follow that which is moſt juſt, and moſt ſafe, becauſe they are Judges betwixt party and party; who ſees not that the Confeſſors and Paſtours of ſouls are obliged to the ſame thing by the ſame reaſon, ſince being Judges betwixt God and Man, they are alſo Judges betwixt party and party? For to imagine that God and Man are not true parties in this interiour judgement, were no other then to pretend that the judgement of penance is no true nor proper judgement; nor act of juriſdiction, againſt the definition of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it being clear that a judgement cannot be but betwixt two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3140"/> So that it muſt needs be that there are truly and properly two parties in the Sacrament of penance, or elſe there is not any proper and true judgement. It is alſo true by the conſent of all Catholicks, that God is both at once Judge and Party in this Divine tribunal againſt the Sinner, and that his infinite Juſtice is the cauſe that theſe two things are not incompatible with him, as they are amongſt men, but <pb n="127" facs="tcp:46318:82"/>they rather are inſeparable, ſince he always in all ſorts of ſins is the firſt offended and the firſt Judge; unleſs haply it be ſo that the Jeſuits think that God is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all, becauſe they ſee him not appear before their Tribunals, and becauſe they find no body preſent himſelf to ſpeak for him, and maintain his rights and intereſts againſt thoſe who confeſſe themſelves unto them, and who conſult them. And thence it comes to paſs that they are ſo complacent and ſo eaſie to graunt upon their ſimple petition all that they demand, as if there were no parties, and their affairs were all matters of favour, and abſolutely depending on their good grace and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure whom they take for their Judges.</p>

                           <p>And he believes that the Confeſſor is in ſuch manner obliged to abſolve this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, that if he fail therein, he ſins ſometimes mortally; and when that happens not, his fault is always great and dangerous, the thing being of great conſequence, according to the opinion of

                           <p>Upon this account the holy Fathers and the firſt Paſtors of the Church had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many mortal ſins, in refuſing abſolution to many penitents who could not want probable reaſons to maintain againſt them, that they were well diſpoſed; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perhaps the Doctrine of probability being not yet ſtarted in thoſe times, the penitents were not ſo well inſtructed then as they may be now, to maintain and defend their rights and Priviledges which this Doctrine giveth them againſt their Confeſſors, and to oblige them to renounce their own judgement ſupported by the authority of all the Doctors ancient and modern, to ſubmit to the private opinion of the penitent, provided that it be probable, and to do for them, and let them do themſelves what they pleaſe.</p>

It muſt needs be of neceſſity that as theſe Doctors aſſure us that ſecular Juſtice ought to be more exact and more fixed to truth in the Judgement, it makes in temporal things, then the ſacred Juſtice of the myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, in the diſpenſation of Spiritual Wealth and eternal Truths, on which depends the Salvation of ſouls.

                           <p>The Prieſt is in an errour, as he now ſaid, and the penitent ignorant, and yet he believes that the Prieſt gives abſolution, and the penitent receives truly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſins, marvellous force of errour and ignorance, or rather of probability, and of an opinion probable in appearance onely, which gives ſuch vertue to errour and ignorance.</p>
                           <p>Nothing can be ſpoken more to purpoſe to conclude that there needs no appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation nor juriſdiction of Biſhops and ordinaries to confeſſe; and this is that which <hi>Sanchez</hi> regards and pretends in his exception rather then the good and ſalvation of ſouls. For if this be truth, which he ſaith, the Monks without having recourſe to Biſhop or Pope, may of themſelves take liberty to confeſſe in all things and all ſorts of perſons. They need onely command their regents to teach that without this their abſolution may be valid. For ſo this opinion becoming probable, it will become lawful. So that putting themſelves afterwards into poſſeſſion, they will acquire ſome right, and the opinion whereupon this right ſhall be founded, though falſe, continuing to be taught by others ſhall become common as well as the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3240"/> and in progreſſe of time this inveterate and publick errour will ſuffice to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and make valid all that they ſhall do in purſuance of this rule:

                           <p>After all this, though their opinion were the falſeſt in the world, and they were aſſured of it themſelves, though they have neither juriſdiction nor approbation, nor priviledges, they would not for all that ceaſe to believe that they have liberty <pb n="131" facs="tcp:46318:84"/>to confeſſe all ſorts of perſons; becauſe that in the moſt depraved conſciences, and the greateſt ſins that can be confeſſed unto them, they may always find with eaſe ſome one which is venial, for which there will be no need of approbation, every Prieſt having power to abſolve them, and the abſolution which he ſhall give for them will extend it ſelf alſo to the others how great and enormous ſoever they may be. All this is the argumentation of <hi>Sanchez,</hi> which I do onely rehearſe and deduce, to make it the more clear.</p>
                           <p>After this we muſt acknowledge that the Jeſuits are very ſober and temperate in their learning; that they uſe not all the power which their Divinity gives them, and that they give great teſtimony of their religious modeſty, and of the eſteem they have for the Pope and the Biſhops when they preſent themſelves before them to demand their priviledges; or their approbations to take confeſſions, it being in their power to attempt and do it themſelves, without ſpeaking to them thereof at all.</p>
                           <p>And this licence belongs not onely unto them but unto all Prieſts, whether they be Monks or not. For all Prieſts as well as they having power to give abſolution for venial ſins, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3250"/> may all alſo abſolve of mortals which are confeſſed with venial; and ſo the abſolution which they ſhall give for the greateſt crimes that are without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the ordinaries, ſhall be valid, and they that have confeſſed them ſhall be thereof truly abſolved, and ſhall not be obliged to repeat their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                           <p>Which is wholly to overturn the order of the Church, and of the Sacrament of Penance, to expoſe it to the moſt profane and ſacrilegious hands of the moſt wicked Miniſters, and to aboliſh abſolutely all the authority of the Biſhops, and of the Pope himſelf, in what concerns the adminiſtration of this Sacrament.</p>
                           <p>From matters of Divinity <hi>Sanchez</hi> paſſeth to thoſe of Phyſick and Law, applying to Judges and Phyſitians that which we have now ſaid of the probability of opinions. He puts this queſtion about Phyſick.

                              <hi>that when the one opinion is as probable as the other, it is more apparent that it is in the power of the Judge to chuſe which he pleaſeth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3270"/> and to follow it in his judgement.</hi> So that, according to this Divinity, the <pb n="132" facs="tcp:46318:85"/>Judges ſhall have great power to oblige their friends, ſince all affairs almoſt may eaſily be made probable in the manner they order and handlethem now a days; and he adds that which follows upon his principle,
<note n="d" place="margin">Imo ceſſante ſcandalo nunc ſecùndum unam, nunc ſecundùm aliam.</note> 
                              <hi>That he may, if it give no ſcandal, judge one while according to one opinion, and an other while according to another opinion.</hi> For if he may chooſe of two probable opinions that which he pleaſeth, it follows thence that he may follow ſometimes the one and ſometimes the other, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it ſhall pleaſe him.

                           <p>He is more troubled to reſolve what the Judge is to do when one of the two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is more probable then the other. He cites ſome Authors who in this very caſe give to the Judge power to pronounce according to what he likes beſt, and even to follow that which he believes to be leſs probable; and to prove their opinion he lends them a reaſon of which he oftentimes made uſe before in like caſes about other matters;

                           <p>IF the Tree may be known by its fruit, and if a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, as Jeſus Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel, we may confidently affirm that the Doctrine of probability is the moſt dangerous that ever appeared in the Church and in the world,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3290"/> becauſe it overturns all things in them both.</p>
                           <p>There is no Chapter in this book that proves not this truth; but becauſe it is important, and that there are, it may be, many perſons that will hardly believeit, and will not eaſily obſerve it, through the whole extent of this treatiſe; I will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent here ſome of the principal proofs of the pernicious conſequences and unhappy effects of this Doctrine.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It favours and nurſes up weak and diſorderly perſons in their miſtakes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, ſinners and libertines in their bad courſes, hereticks in their hereſies, and Pagans in their infidelity.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It teaches to elude the Commandments of God and the Church, and it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns Laws Civil, Eccleſiaſtick, and Divine.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It deſtroys the authority of Princes over their Subjects, of Paſtors of the Church over the Faithful, of Fathers over their children, Maſters over their Servants, of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours in Religious Orders over their Inferiours, and generally of all Superiours over their Inferiours.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. It introduces independence, and leads to irreligion.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. It cannot be deſtroyed nor hindred from having courſe in the world, if it be once therein received and taught.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3300"/>
                           </p>
                           <p>Every one of theſe points are handled largely enough in diverſe places of this Book, where may beſeen the paſſages of the Jeſuits Authors which I have cited for their verification. Wherefore, to avoid repetitions, I ſhall often onely give a ſhort touch here, as I paſſe, of what they ſay upon the moſt part of theſe points, relating upon the reſt ſome other new paſſages of their Authors. I will alſo recite ſome out of one of their principal and moſt faithful diſciples and partakers, <hi>Caramuel</hi> by name. This is the onely exception to be found in all this work, of my deſign which I have to rehearſe onely the Authors of the Society; if yet in this it can be ſaid that I depart from my deſign, ſince it is ſtill onely the Jeſuits that ſpeak by the mouth of one of their diſciples, who doth nothing but deduce and explicate their opinions. But if ſometimes he ſeem to be tranſported, and to expatiate too far in the licence of their Doctrine, he draws always his concluſions from their Doctrines, and he often ſupports them by their very reaſons; and in all the liberty of his ſtile and ſpirit, he advances nothing but what is compriſed and contained in the maximes of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which I have repreſented in the preceding Articles.</p>
                           <p>It had not been hard for me to have drawn the very ſame conſequences with him. But beſides that I make ſome ſcruple to aggravate or publiſh the miſchief before it appeares and breaks forth of its own accord, it goes ſometimes to ſuch an exceſſe that it ſeems incredible, if they themſelves who are the Authors thereof did not both own and publiſh it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3310"/> And this hath cauſed me to take this diſciple of the Jeſuits for the interpreter of their opinions, as being proper to repreſent moſt clearly and moſt ſurely the pernicious effects of their Doctrine of probability. But becauſe the matter is of great extent, I will divide them into ſeveral Paragraphs, according to the points I even now obſerved.</p>

<hi>Eſcobar</hi> rejoices himſelf, and attributes it to a particular favour of Gods Providence, that he and his Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have diſcovered in theſe laſt days many new ways unto Heaven, which have been unknown to all the Saints of the ages paſt, to the Church, and to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who hath not ſpoken thereof in his Goſpel, or if he have, it hath been onely to condemn them, and to advertiſe men to flye from them as the broad ways which lead unto damnation.</p>
                           <p>This ſame Jeſuit may alſo ſay in the tranſport of his joy, and in the conſequence of his principles, that if his ways to Heaven ſo ſweet and ſo eaſie had been ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the Church would not have been ſo ſevere in its diſciplice,

                           <p n="4">4. The Doctrine of probability is alſo very proper to nouriſh the infidels in their infidelity. For if it be true that of two opinions we may follow that which is leſs probable with a ſafe conſcience, whatſoever we repreſent to a Pagan to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him, he may ſtill abide in his Idolatry: becauſe although we make the Chriſtian Religion very probable unto him, and he ſee clearly that it is more probable then his; yet it is very hard, and as it were impoſſible to convince him in ſuch ſort that there ſhould remain no doubt of our faith in his ſpirit, and no reaſon which may render his Religion probable; and by conſequence he may perſiſt always in his paganiſme, without being almoſt at all obliged on pain of damnation to quit it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3390"/> that he may receive the faith of the Goſpel.</p>
                           <p>This argumentation is certain and evident after the principles of the Jeſuits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability: but it will be leſs ſuſpected, when we ſhall know that it is taken out of <pb n="137" facs="tcp:46318:87"/>

And he anſwers 1. that according to ſome it is not enough to make him ſee that the Goſpel is credible, but that it muſt be made alſo more credible unto him than his own Sect, though it do not ceaſe to appear unto him alſo credible. But he anſwers in the ſecond place that this opinion pleaſeth him not at all, and pretends that in this very caſe a Pagan is not bound at all to embrace the Faith:

That is to ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3570"/> that a full remiſſion of all ſins may be obtained by a new ſin, and by a ſin perhaps as great or greater then the others; and ſo a man may be abſolved and condemned together by one and the ſame action. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes of the Stoicks are not more ſtrange, and yet this is probable according to Jeſuits, becauſe <hi>Granado</hi> and
<hi>Eſcobar</hi> have held it, and it is lawful to follow their Counſel in rejecting the contrary.</p>
                           <p>Diſpenſations as well as indulgences, are the graces and favours of the holy Chair; and as the Pope doth not commonly grant indulgences, but with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doing certain actions, which he preſcribes for the gaining them, ſo neither doth he grant any diſpenſations but for certain cauſes, which are alledged to obtain them. But, as <hi>Eſcobar</hi> holds, that indulgences may be gained by criminal actions, ſo he ſaith, alſo that a diſpenſation may be gained and uſed lawfully, though the cauſe upon which it is demanded be falſe, and that it be grounded on no reaſon at all.

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3580"/> That is to ſay, that becauſe one fault is made, a ſecond may be made without fault. For he affirms that it is a ſin at leaſt venial to demand a diſpenſation without juſt cauſe; and he holds that having once obtained it, we may uſe it even without venial ſin. This is as if he ſhould ſay that having once gotten goods unjuſtly, we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them without injuſtice.</p>
                           <p>He adds

And ſo all the Laws of the Church ſhall be expoſed to contempt and mens malice, who may procure themſelves to be diſpenſed with therein by lyes and falſities, and after ſerve themſelves with thoſe diſpenſations, without committing more then venial ſin, which paſſeth for nothing with the Jeſuits.</p>
                           <p>After this it will be found leſs ſtrange which the ſame <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſaith, that when a diſpenſation is procured upon any juſt cauſe, the cauſe ceaſing, yet the very ſame diſpenſation may be made uſe of.

                           </head>
                           <p>TO make this truth appear, we muſt obſerve, that there are four ſorts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for ruining the Authority of Superiors.
1. By corrupting or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principle of it. 2. By bounding it, and encroaching upon it. 3. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting or weakning its commands. 4. By hindring Subjects from obeying.</p>
                           <p>The Jeſuits by the Doctrine of Probability, corrupt the Authority of the Church in the original of it, in attributing to it no other than a mere humane power. They retrench and deſtroy it, in not conſenting that it may preſcribe the inward actions of vertue; they bound it, and encroach upon it, by the irregularity of their Priviledges, which they abuſe, to the contempt of the commands and Ordinances of Biſhops, and invading their Juriſdiction; they utterly aboliſh ſome of their Laws, and they weaken others of them, and there are hardly any unto which they have not given ſome aſſault, by the multitude of inventions they have found out to defeat and elude them.</p>
                           <p>Theſe points are entirely verified in the whole proceſs of this Book, and ſome of them in entire Chapters. But that which is remarkable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3740"/> and very proper to juſtifie what I pretend here, is this, that the means and the armes which they and thoſe who follow their opinion, make uſe of to fight againſt the Authority of the Church in all theſe manners, are the maxims of their Doctrine of Probability.</p>
                           <p>The Authority of the Church is of it ſelf aſſured and uncontroulable, being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the firm rock of Gods Word: For this cauſe there cannot be found a means more ready, or more infallible to ruine or weaken it, than to undermine its foundation, and to make it depend on humane reaſon and authority, ſubmitting its Juriſdiction and its power, to the diſputes and conteſts of the Schools, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in that manner every thing probable that reſpects its power, that they may afterwards become the Arbitrators and Maſters thereof.</p>
                           <p>It is not needfull here to repeat all that is found in the body of this Book, to prove this truth; it is ſufficient only to report ſome paſſages of their Authors, and their Diſciples, in which they avow themſelves, that the Doctrine of Probability doth abſolutely ruine the Authority of the Church, and of all ſorts of Superiors; and they make it ſo clear in the examples that they produce, that after they are read, it ſeems not that any perſon can doubt thereof.</p>
                           <p>Hereof ſee one manifeſt proof in the caſe which
<hi>Caramouel</hi> propounds in theſe terms:

                              <hi>A man relying on an opinion ſweet and indulgent, but probable,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3750"/> diſobeys his Superior in a thing in which it is probable that he is not obliged to obey, but it is more probable that he is obliged. The Superior following the opinion which is more ſafe, <pb n="151" facs="tcp:46318:94"/>judges that he ought to obey, and therefore that he hath ſinned. It is enquired, whether he may act againſt him, and puniſh him as diſobedient?</hi> See here the queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed according to the rules of Probability. The Superior hath reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; the Inferior hath reaſon not to obey, both founded on Probability. The perſon of the Superior is more conſiderable, and his pretenſion more juſt, beſides it is more probable. Let us ſee notwithſtanding what will be the judgement of the Doctors of this Science.

                              <hi>I anſwer,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caramouel, that the Inferior ſins not; and I ſay further, that the Superior may follow which of the two probable opinions he pleaſeth, and by conſequence judge that the other is obliged to obey him; but he having followed a probable opinion, is innocently ignorant of this obligation. But the Superior ſhall be raſh if he judges that he ſins, becauſe it is not probable that he ſins who follows a probable opinion; and ſo it being probable that this private man hath not ſinned, the Superior ſhall be unjuſt if he treat him as guilty; for where there is no fault, there is no need of remedy, nor puniſhment.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is no perſon who ſeeth not that this anſwer overturneth in a manner all the Authority of Superiors, of what condition or order ſoever they be, ſince the reaſoning of this Author is general,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3760"/> and comprehends them all. For through the extreme licence which they have at this day introduced, to make almoſt every thing probable, and to found this probability upon any likely reaſon, or upon the advice of one ſingle man, as do the Jeſuits, it will hardly happen at all that a Superior can make any command, in which ſome probability occurres not, which may take away his power of cauſing himſelf to be obeyed, and to puniſh the rebellious, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be innocent, and more juſt and reaſonable than himſelf.</p>
                           <p>If this Superior be condemned of raſhneſs and injuſtice, in following the more probable opinion, he ſhall be by much ſtronger reaſon if he follows the leſs probable.</p>
                           <p>So that whatſoever he doth, and on what ſide ſoever he turneth, in any difference which he ſhall have with his Subjects, he cannot avoid condemnation, if he be judged at the Tribunal, and according to the Laws of Probability; and it ſeems that as this Doctrine was not invented but to favour looſeneſs, and diſorder, and vice in all ſorts of profeſſions, it hath alſo for its principal ſcope, to fight againſt and to deſtroy as much as is poſſible, the perſons that are eſtabliſhed by God to hold the Word in duty, and all things in order.</p>
                           <p>This is evident, that the Doctors themſelves of this new Science are conſtrained to confeſs, that if the principles of their Probability be held to, we muſt ſpeak no more of Scripture,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3770"/> nor of Superiors, and that they do only delude their Inferiors, having no authority or power at all.</p>

                           <p>He avows the miſchief of this Doctrine which he himſelf terms pernicious, and alſo that he knows no remedy for it at all; That is, that it is wholly inevitable. Whence it is eaſie to conclude, that by the very rules of Logick, unto which he addicts himſelf, as the principal rule of Truth, the Doctrine from whence iſſues by infallible conſequence ſo great errours, is truly pernicious, and entirely falſe; becauſe it is indubitable in Logick, that from a true concluſion, nothing but truth can follow; and likewiſe that that from whence falſe and pernicious concluſions may be drawn, muſt needs be falſe and pernicious it ſelf; without troubling ones ſelf to ſeek other reaſons to prove it, this ſame being evident and certain by the light of Nature only, and by the acknowledgement of them who are the Authors and Defenders of this Doctrine.</p>
                           <p>We need no other proofs to make appear,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3790"/> that this Doctrine introduceth Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, and the ruine of all ſorts of Authority, ſince the principal Defenders of it acknowledge it; and by the ſame reaſon it is entirely oppoſed to the ſpirit and conduct of Faith, and leads to Irreligion. For the true Faith and true Religion being nothing but Obedience, and being given us of God to captivate our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to revealed Truths, the one and the other keeps our ſpirit under a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual dependance, and voluntary ſubmiſſion unto the Word and Will of God.</p>
                           <p>But the Jeſuits Doctrine of Probability, gives the ſpirit of man a Soveraign liberty, which ſubmits it ſelf to nothing, and reſerves alwayes to it ſelf a power, not only to condemn and approve what it pleaſes, but alſo to condemn that which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, and to approve what it condemns, paſſing from one to another, and even from the more probable to the leſs probable, without fearing to engage it ſelf at all in the leaſt ſin; and pretending alwayes to walk in an aſſured way, and more then probable in the midſt of Probabilities, which environ us on every ſide, ſince they have made probable almoſt all the rules of life and humane converſe, and have even elevated mens ſpirits above all theſe Probabilities, to a Soveraign Independance.</p>

                           <p>THere is nothing more eaſie, than to introduce into the Schools a new opinion, and to make it probable according to the Jeſuits,

                           <p>Finally, there is nothing more eaſie, than to uphold and bring it in credit, its own pleaſantneſs, and the approbation that ſome give it, being ſufficient to acquire unto it new Partizans, and new Defenders, who will publiſh it, and induce it unto practice: and ſo it will have for it the approbation of Divines, the example of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, and plauſible reaſons, which are all foundations of Probability. And being once eſtabliſhed in this manner, it will as it were be impoſſible to deſtroy and diſcredit it; and conſequently there will be no means to hinder the World from following it, or the Authors who have undertaken its defence, to teach and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it.</p>
                           <p>For 1. It is well known what trouble it is to undo things that are paſſed into cuſtom, and evil things rather than good; and amongſt evil things, thoſe which are moſt pleaſing and favourable to the corrupt inclinations of nature, give moſt trouble in rooting them out, and we hardly ever obtain our deſign therein.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. When a cuſtom, which hath taken birth from an evil maxim, is alſo propped up by apparent reaſons, and the authority of thoſe that have reputation of being vertuous and learned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3820"/> the evil becomes as it were incurable, and without remedy. And this is that which we have ſeen to happen to the moſt part of the new and pernicious opinions, under which the Church groans at this day, whilſt it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Authors of theſe opinions make uſe of no other armes commonly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, nor admit of others to oppoſe them, than reaſon; they ſubmit all to diſpute, they examine all by the rules of Logick, by Syllogiſmes and Subtilties: So that he who is moſt proper to catch at niceties, and conteſt about them, carries it commonly, though his cauſe be the weaker and leſs reaſonable.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3840"/> are ſubject to innumerable difficulties, which the moſt learned and the moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious know not oftentimes how to explicate. And ſo every thing ſhall be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and probable: There ſhall be no difference betwixt good and bid Doctrine, and it ſhall be lawfull for all men to follow what they pleaſe in every kind of matter, which is the proper ſcope of theſe Doctors of Probabilities.</p>
                           <p>The evil Doctrine ſhall have even all ſorts of advantage above the good, becauſe according to this Caſuiſt, he that maintains it needs prove nothing of that he ſaith, nor anſwer to any thing that can be ſaid againſt him, but by Probabilities.

                           <p>And when he hath entirely diſarmed him, and deſtroyed all his reaſons, making him ſee clearly that they are of no value, and that they are not ſo much as probable only, he hath yet gained nothing at all.

                     <p>Father <hi>Cauſin</hi> in a Book which he intituled,
<hi>An Apology for the Religious of the Society of Jeſus,</hi> having undertaken to excuſe the unhappy Doctrine which F. <hi>Hereau</hi> taught in their Colledge of <hi>Clermont</hi> at <hi>Paris; He did not conſider,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that there are Doctrines like unto thoſe trees which do no hurt in one Country, and ſpoil all when they are tranſplanted into another; and there are Diſputations which it may be would be found good in</hi> Italy,

                     </head>
                     <p>THey that are not at all informed of the maxims of the Jeſuits, wonder when they hear ſay that they are ſo little conſtant and faithfull in their words, and in their actions: others who have ſome knowledge of their opinions, report, that ordinarily the cauſe of this proceeds from the Doctrine of equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of which they make profeſſion. But thoſe who know them better, give thereof a reaſon more clear and more eaſie, drawn from the principles of their Divinity: For there is no need to have recourſe to equivocations to deceive, if we believe we may lye with a good conſcience; and it ſeems fooliſh to rack ones wits to find a word with double ſenſe, to cover and diſguiſe his thought, if he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it is lawfull to ſpeak and do quite contrary to what he thinks, and to quit his own opinion to follow that of another, when he finds it more favourable for him; keeping ſtill the liberty to reſume his own, and to follow it when he ſhall have occaſion for it, and ſo to paſs from the one to the other, giving unto the ſame difficulties contrary advices and reſolves, following his own humour, or complying with theirs who demand his counſel.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the certain maxims of the Jeſuits Divinity, as I have made appear above; after which it ought not be thought ſtrange, that they are ſo inconſtant in all their wayes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4080"/> that they believe they may affirm and deny, approve and condemn the ſame things, and that we ſee nothing but diſguiſes and contradictions in their words and carriages.</p>
                     <p>One of their moſt ordinary contradictions, is to acknowledge Truths in their general Propoſitions, and to deſtroy them in the particulars and practice.</p>
                     <p>This may be ſeen clearly in F. <hi>Bauny</hi> in many places of his Books, as in his <hi>Summe</hi> c. 3. p. 49. where ſpeaking of Penance, he agrees, <hi>that if we look for heaven and eternal life, without firſt doing penance for our ſins, it is mortal ſin.</hi> And in the 43. ch. and 69. p. he declares, that pardon of ſin, and correction, are two things inſeparable; and that the one is not given, but after the other:
<hi>Non datur venia niſi correcto.</hi> And in the 38. ch. p. 589. ſpeaking of a Conſeſſor, and of the cogniſance he ought to have of the diſpoſition of a penitent: <hi>In truth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as he holds the place of a Judge in the Sacrament, as ſaith the Council in the</hi> 14.
<hi>ſeſſion and</hi> 9. <hi>ch. he cannot, nor ought paſs ſentence, but on what he hath a full and perfect cogniſance of.</hi> And in the following page he cites the C. <hi>Omnis utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque ſexus,</hi> where the Confeſſor is ſpoken of in theſe terms:
<note n="a" place="margin">Debet diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inquirere &amp; peccatoris cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantias &amp; peccati, quibus prudenter intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligat quale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat ei praebere conſilium, &amp; cujuſmodi remedium adhibere, diverſis experimentis utendo ad ſanandum aegrotum.</note> 
                        <hi>He ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inform himſelf of the circumſtances which reſpect the ſinner, as well as which reſpect his ſin, that he may judge prudently what counſel he ought to give him, and what remedy he ought to preſcribe him; making uſe of ſundry experiments to cure his diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in his Practique, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4090"/> book 1. chap. 14. pag. 121. ſpeaking of the principal things whereof a Biſhop ought to inform himſelf in making a Viſitation in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he obſerves this ſame, which is taken out of the ſecond Council of <hi>Remes,</hi> under
<hi>Charlemain,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> 3. in the 16. ch. That they ſhould obſerve,

                     </p>
                     <p>The other Jeſuits acknowledge with him the ſame maxims, as the fundamental rules of Penance: but after they have acknowledged them in general, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and violate them in their conduct: they even condemn thoſe that would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, and eſtabliſh others quite contrary, without fear of falling not only into manifeſt contradictions, but alſo into a viſible contempt of thoſe Truths which they have acknowledged, and of rendring themſelves by this carringe unexcuſable before God and men.</p>

                     <p>And in the 40. ch. 650. p. he ſaith, <hi>That if any one of ignorance and ſimplicity have accuſed himſelf of his faults only in groſs, without determining any one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it will not be needfull to draw out of his mouth the repetition of ſuch faults.</hi> As if he had a deſign to recant what he had ſaid above, <hi>That a Confeſſor who holds the place of a Judge in this Sacrament, as the Council ſpeaks in the</hi> 14.
<hi>ſeſſ. and</hi> 19. <hi>chap. cannot paſs ſentence but of what he hath an entire and full cogniſance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the 5. ch. 68. p. <hi>It ſufficeth not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to diſcharge our duty, to ſay to a Confeſſor that we have ſtoln in notable quanity ſufficient to offend mortally, if we do not rate and ſpecifie the ſum: becauſe he ought to know the condition of his penitent, which cannot eaſily be done, unleſs he unfold unto him the value of his theft.</hi> And yet in the 39. ch. 616. p. he is not afraid to maintain the contrary in theſe terms: <hi>It is not neceſſary in Confeſſion to relate the ſaid circumſtance,</hi> the quantity of the theft, as whether one ſtole five, or fifty Crowns. <hi>It will ſuffice in rigour to ſay to his Confeſſor, that in matter of ſtealth he hath ſinned mortally, taking from another the ſumme which maketh and conſtituteth that ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the 3. ch. 46. p. he ſaith, <hi>That he who receiveth the Supper, or hears a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon without applying his heart thereto, ought not to be eſteemed an Hugenot.</hi> But in the 20. ch. 336. p. he ſaith, <hi>That he who without intention of idolizing it, doth bend his knee before an Idol, ſhall yet be held for an Idolater.</hi> As if to receive the Supper amongſt Hugenots, were not as well an action of an Hugenot, as to kneel before an Idol is an action of an Idolater.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame 20. ch. p. 332. he ſpeaks thus: <hi>Since true devotion is inward, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4110"/> and not in the demeanour, or without, and in the countenance and other exteriour ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and that this pretended devotion, deſtitute of that which is within, is but a vizor and idol of devotion, the caſe is reſolved, that in voluntary diſtraction and wandring of the mind in praying by obligation, as do Prieſts, Deacons, and Subdeacons, and Beneficiaries, there is ſin; and ſo they be obliged to begin the Office again, which they have ſaid with ſo much indevotion. For the will of the Church is, that by this action which it commands them, they ſhould praiſe and pray to their Creator. And can they do that, having nothing leſs whilst they pray than God before their eyes? They ought then for to ſatisfie their duty, begin their Office again, and if they fail to do it, they ought to make reſtitution to the Church wherein their Benefice is, or to the poor, the benefit they have received according to the rate of their omiſſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And on the contrary he ſaith, <hi>That the Church ſeemeth to him, in the precept of reciting the Hours, to exact of the Prieſts and thoſe who are obliged thereto, only to honour and praiſe God: chaunting Pſalms and ſinging, though with voluntary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, wherein they continue, provided that they ſing tunably and with reverence.</hi> Of which he renders this reaſon in the ſame place: <hi>For the outward action by which we attend on God, is of the kind and appertains unto the vertue of Religion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they who without intention of Idolatry bow their knee before an Idol, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding guilty of Idolatry; ſo we muſt believe that they pray, who recite the Office though without intention,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4120"/> but not without that decency and outward compoſure which ſuch an action requires.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And a few lines after he reaſons thus, and draws this practique concluſion: <hi>It follows that the Confeſſor cannot blame the penitent of a mortal fault, for applying his mind to frivolous things, whilſt that his tongue ſounded in the Church with others the praiſes of God, if outwardly he did nothing that was incompatible with this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <p>It would be hard to find in two Authors, who had different deſigns to contradict and refute one another, opinions ſo oppoſite, and contradictions ſo viſible For theſe oppoſe one another in their principles, in their concluſions, and in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

                     <p>And that which is yet more aſtoniſhing, is that they make theſe ſo ſtrange changes almoſt in a moment; and they may be met with ſometimes in the ſame page, and ſometimes within two or three lines, as may appear in ſome of the places which I have cited. But I cannot paſs by one important and manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the ſame Author, which is found in his Practique in the 3. book, 44. ch. 727. p. For after he had ſaid in the precedent page, that <hi>the Ordinary may and ought admoniſh the Rectors to execute their charges themſelves; whereunto if they were not obedient, they might be deprived.</hi> He addes in approbation of this carriage: <hi>And indeed the contrary cuſtom ſeems to me only an inveterate errour, which through length of time becomes greater and more abuſive; quia diuturnitas temporis non minuit, ſed auget peccatum.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>It appears clearly that in one place he ſaith, that
<hi>the uſe of not reſiding upon Cures, is no other thing than an inveterate errour;</hi> and in the other place, <hi>that cuſtom of not reſiding gives a diſcharge to all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In one place he ſaith, that <hi>length of time renders the errour of Non-reſidence greater and more abuſive;</hi> in the other, that

                     <p>It ſeems that this liberty of maintaining and publiſhing contrarieties, is granted the Jeſuits by their Superiors, with permiſſion to print theſe Books wherein ſuch contrarieties are found. Therefore it is leſs ſtrange, that their Superiors pretend to have this right as well as private perſons, and make uſe of it without ſcruple in occurrents wherein they judge it advantageous to the good of their affairs, as it did appear by the anſwer of F. <hi>Cotton</hi> to the Gentlemen of the Parliament of
<hi>Paris,</hi> upon the matter of <hi>Santarel</hi>'s Book, which is well enough known in <hi>Paris,</hi> and in <hi>France.</hi> For thoſe Gentlemen objecting to him, that <hi>Viteleſchi</hi> General of the Society had approved the Book, he anſwered together with three other Jeſuits that accompanied him as their Provincial: <hi>That the General could not do otherwiſe, becauſe they at</hi> Rome <hi>would have him do ſo.</hi> The Gentlemen of the Parliament demanded of him, if he were of the ſame judgement, and approved ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings? <pb n="166" facs="tcp:46318:102"/>He confeſſed that as for <hi>Santarel</hi>'s Book, he did not approve it at all; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4150"/> but as to the action of the General, if he had been at

And lately alſo F. <hi>le Moine</hi> in his Apology ſpeaks thus of theſe very Books: <hi>We have declared a long time ſince, that we know not theſe Authors, which we believe not to be of our Society; and alſo at this day we may protest in ſincerity, that they are as unknown to us as they were before.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is not afraid to give the lye to his General
<hi>Viteleſchi,</hi> and other Divines of his Society, who have approved the Book of the Jeſuit <hi>Alagambe,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4160"/> which aſcribes theſe Books to the very Authors Jeſuits, to whom they have been alwayes attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But Father <hi>le Moine,</hi> who knew them not at <hi>Paris,</hi> would have known them at <hi>Rome</hi> it may be, if he had been there: and this ſame ſincerity which made him proteſt that he knew them not in
<hi>France,</hi> would have made him in <hi>Flanders</hi> or in <hi>Italy</hi> have declared quite contrary, by the rule of the Society, which wills that they comply with the times, places and humours of all the World.</p>
                     <p>This manner of acting and ſpeaking is ordinary enough amongſt the Jeſuits, and they are already ſo accuſtomed to contradictions, that they fear no more the reproach which is caſt upon them continually for defending vice and errour; but they are rather rendy to glory therein, and ſhortly to make publick profeſſion thereof; ſince

                  </p>
                  <p>The ordinary vice of women, and principally of thoſe of Quality, is luxury and vanity. They cannot have a fairer pretence for to nouriſh, nor a better excuſe to juſtifie themſelves in the exceſs they commit therein, and the ſcandals which fall out thereupon, than to ſay that it is the cuſtom, and that they do nothing but what is commonly done in the World by women of their condition. <hi>Bauny</hi> approves this reaſon, and makes uſe of it in his <hi>Summe,</hi> ch. 46. p. 717, &amp; 718. where he propoſes this queſtion: <hi>If maids and women, who exceed modeſty and duty, and as we may ſay neceſſity of decency in their habits, becauſe they ſeek out therein curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities not ſuitable to their eſtates, may be thought capable of abſolution, when they know that ſome take thence occaſion of ſinning?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He acknowledgeth that many condemn this inſupportable vanity, and maintain that maids and women who are ſo diſpoſed, and will ſo continue, are uncapable of abſolution; but he declares againſt their judgement, and concludes in theſe terms: <hi>Nevertheleſs we muſt ſay,</hi> 1. <hi>that the woman who trims and adorns her ſelf to pleaſe her Husband, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4240"/> ought not to be blamed,</hi> though ſhe doth it as he ſaith through vanity and curioſity, and againſt modeſty,
<hi>knowing well that ſome draw from thence occaſion of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaith moreover, <hi>that neither is ſhe more to be blamed,</hi> if ſhe trim her ſelf in this ſort with ſcandal, <hi>when ſhe doth it to ſatisfie the cuſtom of the Countrey, and not to be ſingular, unlike and inferiour to thoſe of their own ſex.</hi> He would then that the pretence of pleaſing her Husband, and a diſorderly and ſhamefull cuſtom, ſhould give liberty to a woman to break out into all ſorts of luxury and vanity, without <pb n="170" facs="tcp:46318:104"/>being blameable; and that cuſtom hath power to change the nature of things, to cauſe that it ſhall be lawfull to tranſgreſs the bounds of modeſty, that vanity ſhall be no longer vanity, that luxury ſhall not be longer luxury, and that ſcandal ſhall be no longer ſcandal.</p>
                  <p>He continues ſpeaking in this manner: 2. <hi>I ſay, though this ſaid woman had knowledge of the bad effects which her diligence in trimming her ſelf would cauſe in the body and ſoul of thoſe who behold her adorned with rich and precious clothes, nevertheleſs ſhe ſins not in making uſe thereof.</hi> The reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe to prevent the offence of another, this woman is not bound to deprive her ſelf of what the Law of the Countrey, and nature it ſelf permits.</hi> That is to ſay, that as cuſtom makes luxury and vanity lawfull for her, ſo it makes ſcandal alſo lawfull for her; and that the abuſes which happens very frequently in this point, by the corruption of the World, are juſt and true Laws, and proper to regulate all things in a Country.</p>
                  <p>I might ſpeak here of Uſury and Symony, which are two vices ſo common at this day, that the Jeſuits cover them much eaſier than others, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4250"/> becauſe that cuſtom hath made them publick.

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Occaſions of Sin. <hi>That the Jeſuits retain men in them, and that according to their maxims there can be no next occaſions of Sin.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ONE of the moſt important, and moſt neceſſary counſels which can be given to a perſon who would avoid ſin, is that he fly the occaſions; and if we obſerve it, we ſhall find that the moſt ordinary cauſe why the moſt part of thoſe who have ſome good deſire and care for their ſalvation, attain not to a true and ſolid converſion, or fall back after a while, is becauſe they have not received this advice, or have not been faithfull in the obſervation of it.</p>
                  <p>This is ſuch, that the Jeſuits acknowledge well indeed the importance and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof, but they aboliſh it in their practice. They acknowledge in general with all Divines, that they who would receive the Grace of God, or preſerve it when they have received it, are obliged to depart from the next occaſions of ſin, which would indubitably deſtroy them. But when queſtion is made about pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to particulars, they grant and accommodate things in ſuch manner, that according to their advice and guidance there are not any next occaſions of ſin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4260"/> and there cannot even be any at all; or if happily againſt their proper rules they be conſtrained to acknowledge ſome, inſtead of withdrawing men from them, they nouriſh them therein, by furniſhing them with ſtore of reaſons and pretexts to continue therein with a ſafe conſcience, ſo that according to them there never will be found any who ſhall be obliged to quit or avoid them.</p>
                  <p>It is by this conduct that <hi>Sancius,</hi> handling this point, ſpeaketh in theſe terms:

                     <hi>I have ſaid formerly, that no perſon is obliged to avoid the next occaſions of ſin, when thereby ſome great loſs will befall him: in this caſe it cannot be ſaid, that he wills this occaſion, but permits it only; becauſe that he withdraws not from this occaſion, is not that he would abſolutely abide in it, but becauſe he would decline the damage which this withdrawing would bring on him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words are general, <hi>none is obliged, nullus tenetur;</hi> and they comprehend all ſorts of perſons, even Eccleſiaſticks and Religious, with whom this Jeſuit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes in the Law of the Goſpel, which obligeth them not only to loſe all the things in the World, rather than ſuffer the loſs of their ſouls; but alſo to cut off their armes and feet, and to pluck out their eyes if they offend them, that is to ſay, if they be occaſions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſin.</p>
                  <p>The loſs for which this Jeſuit pretends,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4270"/> that <hi>none is obliged to eſchew the next occaſion of ſin,</hi> how great ſoever it be, cannot be of things ſo dear as eyes, nor ſo neceſſary as hands and feet: For this cauſe if our Lord will have eyes pull'd out, and feet and hands out off, by ſtronger reaſon doth he oblige to ſuffer all other loſs to avoid offence, and to withdraw from the occaſions and danger of being loſt by offending God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tambourin</hi> ſaith almoſt the ſame thing, and attempts to juſtifie it by the ſame reaſon, maintaining that if any one cannot quit the occaſion of ſin without cauſing of ſcandal, or without ſuffering ſome damage ſpiritual or temporal, he is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged thereto, becauſe then it may be judged morally, that this is not to ſeek an occaſion voluntarily, but to ſuffer it. He determines not at all this damage ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or remporal, teſtifying that of what ſort ſoever it be, ſmall or great, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to retain a man in the next occaſions of ſin with a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>If the reaſon of theſe Authors had been good, to wit, that he who to avoid loſs, continues in the next occaſion of ſin, neither wills nor loves this occaſion of ſin, <pb n="172" facs="tcp:46318:105"/>but ſuffers it, becauſe he loves it not for it ſelf alone, but for the benefit that comes to him therein, or for the evil which he would avoid, we muſt ſay that we cannot be guilty in any occaſion of ſin, and that we ſhall never be obliged to avoid it, but when it is affected and ſought out for its own ſake: which hardly ever happens, men not breaking out unto evil,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4280"/> but for the benefits which are annexed unto them in deed, or in appearance, or to deliver themſelves from other evils which they fear more.</p>
                  <p>We cannot find a more proper example to clear up this, than that which <hi>Sancius</hi> himſelf preſents us with in theſe following words:
<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Inde nec tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur domo eji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere concubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, ſi concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binatio ſit nimis utilis ad lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crandum bona temporalia, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia negotiatione.</hi> Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Hence it comes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that a man is not obliged to cauſe his Concubine to depart out of his houſe, if her company be very advantageous unto him, in regard of his gain by Traffick.</hi> Which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, ſaying the ſecond time,
<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Concubinam ejicere non erit obnoxius, ſi ex ejectione magnum emolumentum non eſſet accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus. Suſſiceret enim proponere deinceps non peccare.</hi> Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>That he is not obliged to put her away, if in putting her away he loſe any great benefit, and that it ſuffices him to reſolve not to ſin any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is to juſtifie one vice by another, and to make uſe of covetouſneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to nouſle a man up in fornication. But beſides this reaſon he produceth yet another, which is,

                     <hi>If the Concubine be very uſefull to the fornicator, to cheriſh him, and to keep him in good humour, ſo that without her he lives in melancholly, and hath great diſtaſt of the food which is prepared for him, and cannot eaſily find another Maid-ſervant who may be proper for him, he cannot be obliged in this caſe to put away his Concubine, becauſe his ſatisfaction in theſe circumſtances are more worth than any temporal good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We then may ſay boldly, that if temporal good and profit, pleaſure and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement ſuffice to diſpenſe with an Whoremaſter to keep his Concubine, there will never be any obliged thereunto,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4290"/> becauſe there will never be any who can want ſuch pretences, which nevertheleſs appear ſo juſt unto this Jeſuit, that he doth not only ſuffer this Whoremaſter to keep his Concubine for theſe reaſons, but he maintains alſo, that

                     <hi>for theſe ſame reaſons if the Concubine die, or withdraw her ſelf, it will be lawfull for him to take another Maid-ſervant, what fear ſoever he have of falling into ſin with her, if he cannot find ſome other who is as capable to aſſist him in his affairs and conveniencies. For if this reaſon diſpenſe with him for not putting her away whom he hath already taken, it will alſo give him a right to take her whom he hath not as yet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There remains nothing more now to this ſort of Divines, but to pretend that it is lawfull for them to find out and direct themſelves ſome Concubine to ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Whoremaſter, who cannot live without one, or to exhort him that hath one not to forſake her, for fear leaſt he ſhould be kill'd with melancholly.</p>

So that the places, the treatments, the company, the converſe which induce men to lewdneſs and debauchery, cannot be next occaſions to ſin according to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: and thoſe who are in wicked places, without giving themſelves over unto evil, ſhall not be engaged in the next occaſions to ſin, and ſhall have done nothing which is forbidden them by the rules of purity, and the Laws of God.

                  <p>But he will not have this rule to be ſo general,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4320"/> that it ſhould have no exceptions, whereof he makes out one in theſe terms:

                  <p>We find not in the Goſpel this marvellous charity, which cauſeth us to expoſe our ſalvation for that of anothers, and which induces us to be damned with them. The Apoſtles and Martyrs were ignorant thereof, having given the life of their bodies to ſave men, but not that

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bauny</hi> ſpeaks of the ſame point in
<hi>French,</hi> as in <hi>Latine,</hi> and he is firm in the ſame opinions, becauſe they could not be more enlarged. For in his <hi>Summe,</hi> c. 46. p.
711. after he had demanded, <hi>If they who in their Traffick, Commerce, diſcourſe, reſorts, were obliged to ſee, to ſpeak, and treat with Maids and Women, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4330"/> whoſe ſight and treatments do cauſe them frequently to fall into ſin, were capable in this perpetual danger of being in grace, and receiving the Sacrament?</hi> He anſwers with <hi>Baia, they may, ſo that the cauſe which draws and induces them at ſuch times into evil, be not of it ſelf a mortal ſin,</hi> non eſt de ſe peccatum mortiferum; <hi>and therefore cannot be held to be of the quality of a next occaſion diſpoſing unto evil, ſuch as the penitent ought then neceſſarily avoid, to poſſeſſe and receive grace in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be conſidered, that it is preſuppoſed that
<hi>the danger is perpetual,</hi> that it <hi>cauſes often to fall into ſin,</hi> that this ſin is of that ſort which is committed by men
<hi>with maids and women;</hi> and yet <hi>Bauny,</hi> who himſelf aſſerts and advances theſe things, maintains at the ſame time, that we are not <hi>to hold a danger of this nature to be in the quality of a next occaſion diſpoſing unto evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſame F. in the 717. page, demands, <hi>What muſt be done with Men and Maid-ſervants, Couſins of both ſexes, Maſters and their Maid-ſervants, who mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually draw and aſſiſt one another in ſin, or take from the houſe wherein they are motives thereunto, from the opportunities they have therein?</hi> To which he anſwers, <hi>that if they offend but rarely together, as once or twice in a month, they may be abſolved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It were eaſie to relate many like caſes which the Jeſuits reſolve in the ſame manner; but I omit them for fear of being too long, to come to a point more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, which diſcovers the principles whereupon they found their anſwers, and the conditions they require unto a next occaſion of ſin. See here the Principles which <hi>Bauny</hi> relates in this manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The occaſion is the next, when it is of it ſelf of a vicious nature, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4340"/> as are all mortal ſins.</hi> In his Summe, 46. ch. 709. p. <hi>It is not ſuch,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baia,</hi> whom <hi>Bauny</hi> alledges for his warrant, <hi>quando non eſt de ſe peccatum mortiferum, when it is not of it ſelf a mortal ſin;</hi> p.
711.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, though a thing be evil and vicious in it ſelf, and ſerve for a next, and as it were certain occaſion of ſin; yet according to <hi>Bauny, it is not ſuch in effect,</hi> that is to ſay, it is not the next occaſion to ſin, <hi>when it is not ſought, and the will is not bent thereupon:</hi> 710. p. Which he expounds more clearly, when he ſaith a little after, that albeit the precept of flying the occaſions of ſin is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and that by conſequence it obligeth alwayes, <hi>this is only with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not to affect and ſeek humerouſly, and without neceſſity that which induces unto ſin;</hi>
712. p.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the third place, he maintains, that a thing is no next occaſion to ſin unto a man, if it be not ſo forcible that it raviſheth him in ſome ſort, and cauſeth him almoſt every time it preſents it ſelf, to fall into ſin; <hi>ſi non adſit aſſiduit as pecoandi.</hi> Which <hi>Bauny</hi> tranſlates and explicates in this manner:
<hi>If the ſaid occaſion do not force, as I may ſay, the ſinner to fall at every ſeaſon, alwayes, and at all times;</hi> 711. p.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the fourth place, although a perſon be engaged in ſome place, company, exerciſe, which cauſeth him often to offend God, they ſay he is not for that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to leave it, if he be retained by any temporal conſideration, as that of wealth, of honour, and even of pleaſure it ſelf; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4350"/>
                     <hi>ſi adſit aliqua notabilis cauſa non ſe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baia,</hi> and which <hi>Bauny</hi> tranſlates better than he thought for, when he rendred it in theſe terms:
<hi>Provided he have ſome ſpecious cauſe which obligeth him to continue in the ſaid occaſion;</hi> 710. p. It matters not, whether this cauſe be juſt or not before God, ſo it be <hi>ſpecious</hi> before men. For ſpeaking of this <hi>ſpecious cauſe</hi> which may oblige men to continue in the neareſt, and as it were certain occaſions of offending God, he expounds it thus: <hi>As when they cannot diſpence therewith without giving the world matter to talk of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:46318:106"/>5. In the fifth place, they aſſure us that a man may with a ſafe conſcience abide in the moſt certain, moſt ordinary, and moſt violent occaſions of ſin, when any temporal intereſt or commodity engageth him therein, provided he form within himſelf a reſolution not to offend God in that eſtate. <hi>Dummodo firmiter proponat non peccare;</hi> p. 712. <hi>provided that he is diſpleaſed with what is paſt, and purpoſes not to fall thereinto again for the future;</hi> 715. p. though he have often made the like reſolutions and proteſtations which have been vain and without effect; <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docunque nulla notetur emendatio,</hi> as <hi>Sancius</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>Bauny,</hi> p. 717. <hi>and though even in deed there be no appearance,</hi> that he who made theſe promiſes and theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, <hi>will do what he promiſes, and hold to what he reſolves,</hi> as <hi>Bauny</hi> ſaith after <hi>Diana,</hi> p. 716. <hi>and though many times it may be preſumed that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions come no farther than from the lip outward,</hi> as ſaith the ſame <hi>Bauny,</hi> 717. p.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sancius</hi> agrees very well with <hi>Bauny</hi> in all theſe points, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4360"/> or rather <hi>Bauny</hi> with
<hi>Sancius,</hi> from whom he ſeems to have taken the greateſt part of what he hath ſaid about theſe next occaſions of ſin, as having found none more large upon this matter, as appears clear enough in what we have related of this matter from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Layman</hi> alſo eſtabliſheth the ſame principles, and requires the ſame conditions in the occaſions of ſin. And after he hath declared, that by the command of God we are obliged to fly the next occaſions, he adjoyns theſe reſtrictions and excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Excipe niſi proximum peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, ſeu occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio mortaliter peccandi ſine gravi incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo corporis, famae, aut fortunarum, tolli non poſſit, tune conſilium quidem eſt minorem illam jacturam majori bono ſecuritatu animae poſthabere, ſed nec praeceptum.</hi> Layman l. 5. tract. 6. cap. 4. num. 9.</note>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the evident danger, and next occaſion of ſinning mortally, cannot be removed without ſome notable damage to body, goods, or reputation. For in this caſe God counſels indeed to ſuffer this loſs, to ſecure the ſalvation of our ſouls, but he commands it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence he draws this concluſion for the reſolving of this very caſe, which F. <hi>Bauny</hi> had already propounded as above:
<note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Quare abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi ſunt qui officio, negolia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, dome in qua peccandi periculum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinque imminet, diſcedere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt, quia ſine maxima diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultate non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt; quia oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio peccandi in ſe peccatum non eſt, neque neceſſitatem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert, aut anim? libertatem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert.</hi> Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>That they are to be abſolved who will not quit a charge, an imployment, a traffick, or an houſe wherein they are in the next and imminent ddnger of ſinning, becauſe they cannot do it without difficulty.</hi> His reaſon is,
<hi>becauſe the next occaſion of ſin being not ſin, neither doth it impoſe any neceſſity of ſinning, and takes not away liberty.</hi> That is to ſay, that if a man be not in danger to loſe his wits and liberty,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4370"/> he is not obliged to avoid and fly from occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſin, how powerfull or evident ſoever they be. So that it is folly that is to be feared in theſe occaſions, rather than ſin, which alſo cannot be committed when wit and liberty is loſt. So that it is clear, that by this Divinity there can be no next occaſion of ſin had, wherein we may not engage and abide with a good conſcience, and without fear of ſin; for how violent ſoever it be, if it leave only wit and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, theſe Doctors hold that it is no ſin to continue therein, becauſe we are not obliged to forſake it; and if it takes away wit and liberty, we cannot ſin though we continue therein, becauſe ſin ſuppoſes liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſcobar</hi> who boaſts to be the mouth unto 24. of the moſt antient and prudent of the Society, ſpeaking of the next occaſions of ſin, ſaith,

836.</note> 
                     <hi>That he calls that the next occaſion of ſin, whereupon it arrives rarely that a man abſtains from ſin, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered.</hi> And as if he apprehended that he ſhould be accounted too ſcrupulous and too ſevere, if he would hereby withdraw perſons from venial ſin, he gives this advertiſement:
<note n="p" place="margin">Certe peccatum ex hujuſmodi occaſione exurgens debet eſſe mortale.</note> 
                     <hi>But yet the ſin which ariſes herefrom muſt be a mortal one.</hi> For a venial ſin is accounted as nothing by this Jeſuit, and by the moſt part of the reſt of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Praeterea talic debet eſſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio, qua nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam aut raro non delinqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note>

                     <hi>Furthermore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the occaſion ought to be ſuch, that it happen never or ſeldom that he ſins not when it preſents it ſelf.</hi> So that to put or hold ones ſelf into ſuch an occaſion, is not ſo much to be expoſed to the danger of ſinning, as to caſt himſelf into ſin it ſelf, ſince he is engaged into a neceſſity of falling thereinto, which he hardly ever avoids. Which agrees very well with what <hi>Bauny</hi> ſaith, <pb n="176" facs="tcp:46318:107"/>that that is the next occaſion of ſin, which is of it ſelf and of its own nature vicious, as all mortal ſin is; and with that which <hi>Layman</hi> ſaith alſo on the ſame ſubject, that we are not obliged to quit a Society, or Occupation, which is the cauſe that we do frequently offend God,

                     <p>I will not enter upon the Diſputes which they have raiſed above theſe ſixty <pb n="186" facs="tcp:46318:110"/>years upon this Subject, troubling the Church with their Intrigues, and by their paſſion in maintaining the Novelties which they acknowledge and boaſt they have invented.

                     <p>The Grace of God is given us, either to do good, or to defend us from ſin, and withdraw us from it when we are fallen thereinto.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To fight againſt the Love of God, is to fight againſt the Grace of God, which cauſeth us to do good; for that good is not done but voluntarily and by love, not by the love of the world, nor of our ſelves, which is always vicious; but by that of God, which is the ſpring of all the good which we receive and do.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Ant. Sirmond, Molina,</hi> and other Jeſuits maintain; ſome, That we ſatisfie the love we owe unto God, by loving him three or four times in our life: and others, That we may paſs over our whole life without any thought of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, and be ſaved after all this; as I ſhall make appear in handling the command of loving God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is to fight with the Grace of God that withdraws us from ſin, to teach that he who is fallen into ſin, is not obliged to ask grace of God, or to ſeek out means to riſe again from it with ſpeed, nor even to accept them when preſented and offered. Yet this is afferted by <hi>Amicus, Eſcobar,</hi> and <hi>Celot:</hi> and

<hi>p.</hi> 816.</note> this laſt expounding himſelf more clearly then the reſt, proceeds ſo far as to ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20040"/> that when God himſelf firſt ſeeks him out that hath offended him, and endeavours to draw and cauſe him to return unto him, by preventing and ſtirring him up by inſpirations and good motions which he beſtows on him, he may reſuſe them without rendring himſelf guilty of any ſin, though he believe that his eternal Salvation depends on theſe good thoughts and good apprehenſions which he ſo inſolently rejects.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This is alſo to fight againſt or deſtroy that very Grace which withdraws us from ſin, to pretend that a ſinner may re-enter into a ſtate of Grace, and diſpoſe himſelf to receive it by the Sacrament of Penance (which is particularly inſtituted to that end) by means of diſpoſitions and actions altogether natural, which come not from Grace, which only can prepare her ſelf a ſeat and ſubject, and diſpoſe the heart of man to receive it.

                     <p>I note only theſe four points as I paſs, to make it appear how the Jeſuits Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity overthrows the foundations of the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe I ſhall ſpeak thereof more largely afterwards when I come to handle theſe points in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and I will inſiſt at preſent only upon ſome paſſages which are more formal and proper for this matter.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20060"/> For comparing our Nature, ſuch as it is now corrupted with ſin, with the ſame as it would have been if God had created it without grace, in its purely natural condition, He ſpeaks in theſe terms:

                        <hi>The powers of Nature are now the ſame that they would have been then, becauſe that original ſin,</hi> which is now in fallen Nature, and had not been in pure and ſimple Nature, <hi>hath not at all dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the natural powers of man, but hath only taken from them the ſupernatural powers of grace, by means whereof nature might more eaſily have exerciſed thoſe honeſt actions which would have been natural unto them, though in that eſtate</hi> (where he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that it had been pure, that is to ſay, without grace and without ſin) <hi>it had not had greater facility to exerciſe theſe ſame natural actions, which it hath at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with original ſin; becauſe original ſin hath not diminiſhed the powers of Nature, as hath been ſaid already; but they remain ſound and entire from ſin, and it hath not introduced into Nature any inclination unto ill, which man ſhould not have had in the eſtate of pure Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is clear, that if nature be not hurt by ſin, as this Jeſuit ſaith, it hath no need of the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſaith, they that are not ſick have no need of the Phyſitian, nor of his Grace; and the prayers of the Saints and of the whole Church, which demand of God inceſſantly by Jeſus Chriſt to deliver them from their evils and infirmities, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20070"/> would be falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable; and ſo they ſhould be no more prayers, but crys and mockeries, and and deridings of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amicus</hi> doth not abſolutely deny that we have inclinations unto evil, and in this he teſtifies himſelf to be a man; but in denying that this inclination comes from original ſin, he neither ſpeaks as a Monk nor a Chriſtian. If it come not from original ſin, but from the foundation of nature, as he pretends, in as much as he ſaith, that it had been in the eſtate of nature, if it had been created without ſin:
<hi>Peccatum originale non poſuit in natura aliquam poſitivam inclinationem ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, quam homo non habuiſſet in pura natura;</hi> it muſt come from God who is the Author of Nature; and by conſequence God ſhould be the Author of evil and of ſin, and this inclination unto evil ſhould have been in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he took our nature with all its natural properties: for whatſoever is not contrary to God as Creator, neither is it contrary to him as Redeemer; and nothing of that which comes immediately from the hand of God alone is unworthy of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>So this Jeſuit deſtroys with one daſh of his Pen Original ſin, the Incarnation and Grace of Jeſus Chriſt. But he doth it no leſs openly when he ſaith a little before, that

                     <p>He declares yet more openly his thoughts upon this Point in the Treatiſe which he made of Merit, where ſpeaking of the Pagans morally honeſt actions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20090"/> he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that they were pleaſing unto God, and true diſpoſitions unto ſaith.

                        <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> For ſeeing that he evidently condemns his opinion, he eludes it by expounding it in this manner:

                     <p>And becauſe theſe expreſſions, <hi>per modum principii, &amp; per modum termini</hi> are not common, he expounds them in the ſequel, applying them unto his ſubject:

                        <hi>Whether the Son of God could have taken on him the nature of man without wit, or have ſuffered it after he had taken it to fall into folly?</hi> He at firſt reports ſome reaſons to prove the opinion which holds, that this cannot be done; but afterwards he declares his own judgment, which is,
<note n="2" place="margin">Affirmans tamen pars non modò probabilior, ſed omnino vera eſt mihi. <hi>Ibid. n.</hi> 129.</note>
                        <hi>That the opinion which holds it poſſible is not only probable, but altogether true according unto him.</hi> And he builds upon this Reaſon,
<note n="3" place="margin">Quia Verbum poſſet aſſumere naturam humanam ſpoliatam omni ſenſu externo. <hi>Ibid. n.</hi>
130.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Word might take humane nature deſtitute of all outward ſenſe.</hi> In which caſe it would alſo be deprived of all uſe of reaſon, which as he proves by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> depends on Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, and on outward and inward ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>This Reaſon is not very worthy of a Jeſuit who ſhould be concerned in the Grandeurs of Jeſus Chriſt, as in thoſe of his own Society who have taken their name from his. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20130"/> But this is not much to honour Jeſus Chriſt, to take ſenſe from him that they may alſo take reaſon from him, and to debaſe him below the beaſts, that ſo they might ſet him below the moſt inferior of men, who had no
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46318:112"/>more reaſon than was neceſſary to make him not to be a beaſt.</p>
                     <p>And, building upon this Principle, he concludes in the proceſs of his Diſcourſe,
<note n="1" place="margin">Ergo non eſt cur ex hoc capite repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Verbum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentem natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram aſſumere, aut amentiam in natura jam aſſumpta ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere: ſicut non ſolum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt aſſumere naturam omni ſenſu externo privatam, ſed etiam talem ſenſuum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationem in aſſumpta jam natura admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere. <hi>Ibid. n.</hi> 130.</note> 
                        <hi>That there is nothing this way that can hinder the Word from taking the nature of a fool, or after he hath taken our nature to ſuffer it to fall into folly, as he cannot only take a nature deprived of all outward ſenſes: but alſo ſuffer it to fall into this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation after he hath aſſumed it.</hi> He is not content only to ſay, that the eternal Word might ſuffer under folly; but he ſaith alſo, that he might have aſſumed it volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, as he aſſumed humane nature. That is, that this propoſition, the impiety and blaſphemy whereof is horrible only to be thought, might have been true: God is a fool, and that with a voluntary folly, which is accounted the worſt of all.</p>
                     <p>He ought to have conſidered, that folly is a diſorder of the body and the Soul, and of the higheſt part of the Soul, which is Reaſon, and that all diſorder is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God, as well as ſin is inconſiſtent with it, becauſe it is a voluntary diſorder and a true folly according to Scripture: and if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Jeſus Chriſt had been diſorderly, it is manifeſt that his Will might have been ſo too; and that as his Will could not be ſo by ſin, which is the folly of the Will, neither could his reaſon be ſo by folly, which is, as we may ſay, the ſin of the Underſtanding, as ſome Philoſophers eſteem.</p>
                     <p>Errour is yet a greater evil than folly, becauſe folly takes away reaſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20140"/> but er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is the cauſe it is ill uſed. Now it were better to be wholly deprived of any thing, then to abuſe it; as it were better not to have wit, then to abuſe it in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; not to have ſtrength, then to abuſe it in committing violences and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and yet <hi>Amicus</hi> forbears not to maintain with others, that Jeſus Chriſt was capable of erring, and that he might erre in deed.</p>
                     <p>For the explication of this opinion, he diſtinguiſheth two ſorts of errours, whereof one reſpects the things we are obliged to know, and which he calls <hi>Error pravae diſpoſitionis,</hi> becauſe it includes a wicked diſpoſition, from whence it proceeds as from its cauſe: the other reſpects ſuch things as we are not obliged to know, which conſiſts in a ſimple privation of knowledge; <hi>error ſimplicis negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> He ſaith

                     <p>Certainly he doth great wrong to doubt of this ſort of errour, after he had ſaid, that we may not doubt of the other. For if it be certain, as he pretends, that the eternal Word might have taken a reaſonable nature deſtitute of all kind of knowledge and wiſdom actual and habitual, it follows manifeſtly that he might have taken it deſtitute of all that knowledge of things which every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature is obliged to know, as of the knowledge of God and of the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon; ſince this ſort of errour is neceſſarily contained in the other.</p>
                     <p>Which follows alſo clearly from the other opinion of the ſame Jeſuit, that Jeſus Chriſt might have taken on him the nature of a fool. For folly is not only an ignorance of principal duties, but of all truths alſo, according to the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the Philoſophers who ſay, that it is a general blindneſs of mind in all things, <hi>mentis ad omnia caecitas.</hi> So that if Jeſus Chriſt might have been a fool in humane nature, he might have been generally ignorant of all the duties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and reaſonable Nature, and of all the principles of Reaſon. And <hi>Amicus</hi> ſhews himſelf as weak a Logician as Chriſtian, in doubting of this laſt Article, <pb n="191" facs="tcp:46318:112"/>after he had ſaid, that we might not doubt of that general Maxime, whereunto it is inſeparably and viſibly annexed.</p>
                     <p>One of the Reaſons of the Jeſuits who teach that Jeſus Chriſt was capable of that errour which hath reſpect unto his duty,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20160"/> which they call an Errour of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved diſpoſition,
<hi>error pravae diſpoſitionis,</hi> and which is not only a ſimple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſimple privation of light, but an oppoſition to the truth, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion contrary to its Rules and Laws; is, That Jeſus Chriſt might accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them have taken the nature of an Aſs, as they expreſs it in theſe very words:
<note n="1" place="margin">Foruit Verbum aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere ſtolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem naturae aſininae: ergo &amp; errorem na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae humanae.
<hi>Amicus ib. n.</hi> 116.</note> 
                        <hi>The Word might have taken upon him the ſottiſh and blackiſh diſpoſition of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Aſs; and by conſequent he might have taken the errour of humane nature.</hi> Which can ſerve for no other thing then to make this opinion more incredible, whether we regard the impiety of theſe ſtrange words: <hi>Potuit Verbum aſſumere ſtoliditatem naturae aſininae;</hi> or we regard the conſequence which is ridiculous: <hi>Ergo &amp; errorem naturae humanae.</hi> For the blockiſh diſpoſition of an Aſs is not an ignorance of his duty, becauſe it hinders not an Aſs to know and perceive all that which he ought to know and perceive according to his nature, and much leſs is it an apprehenſion oppoſed unto truth, which the nature of an Aſs is uncapable to know. And ſo though it were true that Jeſus Chriſt might have been united to the nature of an Aſs, it would not have followed, that he might have been united to a reaſonable nature ingaged in errour, and in errour contrary to his duty.</p>

                        <hi>That it is no more repugnant to the divine Word to erre or to ſpeak a thing falſe in it ſelf by the nature which he hath aſſumed, then to be tormented and dye in the ſame nature.</hi> I will not ſtay to examine this Reaſoning, nor to tell what the difference is betwixt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and erring or ſpeaking falſhood, to make appear that the one is unworthy and impoſſible in regard of Jeſus Chriſt, and not the other. I ſhall do no other thing but briefly repreſent, according to my deſign, what theſe Jeſuits ſay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſaith, that as Jeſus Chriſt might ſuffer and dye, ſo he might likewiſe erre and ſpeak falſe, even in the things he was obliged to know, and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained, as <hi>Amicus</hi> expounds himſelf, to his condition and duty. This is to ſay plainly enough, that Jeſus Chriſt might ſin, not only in his humane nature, but in his God-head it ſelf. For though a man may ſometimes erre and ſpeak falſe through ignorance, this ignorance excuſes him not in things which he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to know, ſince it is of theſe that the Goſpel ſaith, that the ſervant who knows not his Maſters will ſhall not go without puniſhment, though he ſhall not be ſo rigorouſly puniſhed as he who hath known and neglected to do it. Now theſe Jeſuits ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt might have erred and ſpoke falſely in the things which appertained to his duty, and which he was obliged to know, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence according to them he might have ſinned and deſerved chaſtiſement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But though it were ſo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20180"/> that Jeſus Chriſt as man and in his humanity might erre and ſpeak falſe without ſin in ſome thing which he was not obliged to know, this could not be ſaid of his God-head which knows all things, and which ought to know all things; and ſo could not be exempt from ſin, if it erred or ſpoke falſe by the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince all the words, thoughts, and actions of this humanity are truly and properly the actions of the Divinity and of the Word who produces them by it as by its inſtrument, according to the Fathers. So that if the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt could erre, it would be the Word that ſhould erre, and ſhould be the Author of this errour and falſhood, and ſhould truly ſin ſpeaking againſt his light and lying voluntarily: which the Jeſuits would not be much troubled to conſent to according to their Principles, though it be a thing horrible to imagine only.</p>
                     <p>For in effect they maintain that Jeſus Chriſt is capable of ſin, as well as errour, as alſo that he might have been ſubject unto vice. <hi>Amicus</hi> ſaith well, that the Word could not have aſſumed an humane nature that was in an eſtate of actual or habitual ſin; but he adds

                        <hi>That there is more difficulty in what concerns the vicious habitudes which this nature might have contracted before it was united to the Word; to wit, to know whether they might yet continue in it after its union with <pb n="192" facs="tcp:46318:113"/>the Word.</hi> And to clear up this difficulty, he ſaith that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20190"/>

<hi>n.</hi> 42.</note> Vaſquez <hi>affirms that alſo, and that though he be of the ſame opinion with himſelf concerning the habitual ſin which the humanity might have contracted before that it was united unto the Word; yet he believes, that the Word in aſſuming this humane nature, might alſo have aſſumed the vitious habits which had been found therein.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I ſee not that it would be leſs diſhonour to Jeſus Chriſt, to hold him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of vitious habits, then of actual or habitual ſins. For vitious habits are the ſprings of ſin, and conſequently contain in them a greater corruption then the ſins themſelves, and the ſins are compriſed in them, as in their ſpring and principle; ſo that he who is capable of the one, is neceſſarily and infallibly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the other.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Jeſuits do formally attribute ſin unto Jeſus Chriſt: alſo they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him capable thereof, when they demand, whether the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, being become a ſinner, Jeſus Chriſt could have ſatisfied for that ſin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame humanity, or by laying that down, and aſſuming ſome other. The propounding only of theſe queſtions is ſo ſtrange and injurious to Jeſus Chriſt, that it offends the faith and ears of the faithful. <hi>Amicus</hi> fails not to anſwer them as ſeriouſly as if they were very important, and of great edification.

                     <p>Obligation unto puniſhment is a propriety and neceſſary conſequent of ſin, and the obligation to eternal pain, the propriety and neceſſary conſequent of mortal ſin. For it is impoſſible, that he who ſins mortally, ſhould not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to eternal puniſhment; and it is alſo impoſſible, that he ſhould be obliged to eternal puniſhment, who hath not ſinned mortally: both the one and the other being equally contrary to Juſtice, and by ſtronger reaſon to the Juſtice of God. Whence it comes, that they who ſay, that an obligation to eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment might befal the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuppoſe of neceſſity that this humanity hath ſinned mortally, and that it may even be actually engaged in mortal ſin whilſt united to the Word in Jeſus Chriſt, it being impoſſible, that he to whom ſin is remitted, ſhould be lyable to eternal puniſhment, and that God can puniſh him eternally to whom he is reconciled, and to whom he owes eternal life, as he owes it to all the juſt, and much more to the Man-God who is his eternal Son.</p>
                     <p>This opinion is maintained by ſome Caſuiſts, as ſaith <hi>Amicus,</hi> but it ſeems to him very rude, and eſpecially to

                     <p>But he is at leaſt conſtrained even by this ſame reaſon to affirm, that Jeſus Chriſt might ſin venially, ſince they hold, that he might be lyable on his own account unto temporal puniſhment, and that the obligation to temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot come but from venial ſin, as the obligation unto eternal puniſhment cannot come but from mortal ſin.</p>

If ſin might have been in Jeſus Chriſt, then ſin is no more ſin; becauſe ſin being no otherwiſe ſin then as it is againſt the will of God, if Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Son of God, and God as well as his Father, could ſin, ſin would be volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto him, not only according to his humanity which did or ſhould commit it; but alſo in regard of his Divinity and divine perſon who ſhould permit it, or take it unto him voluntarily in the Humanity which ſhould be perſonally united unto him, as well as the other qualities and actions of this humanity which are proper to him, and appertain unto him in ſome ſort more than unto the humanity it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But if God could will ſin, or be partaker thereof by aſſuming it, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it voluntarily in a nature which ſhould be united unto him; God ſhould be no more God, becauſe he ſhould be no longer the ſupream Truth, which is more inconſiſtent with ſin, which is nothing elſe but errour, injuſtice, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, then light is with darkneſs.</p>

But to move them unto horror and deteſtation of ſo ſtrange an opinion, it is ſufficient to conſider, that it tends to deſtroy both the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, and even his Divinity it ſelf. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20260"/> For as in dying voluntarily in his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he did put ſin to death, and deſtroyed the Empire of the Devil, who was the Author of his death, becauſe he ſuffered this death unjuſtly, being innocent, and having no ſin at all; this opinion on the contrary attributing ſin unto him, makes him dye at once both in his Humanity and Divinity, and ſubjects him to the power of the Devil to favour and revive ſin.</p>

This ſorrow is a vertue which appertains to Religion; and it is alſo one part of the Sacrament of Penance ſo neceſſary and ſo conſiderable, that it hath given even its name thereunto.

The Jeſuits conſent well unto this Catholick Truth; they do truly affirm; that we cannot abſolutely obtain pardon of ſins without acknowledging with ſorrow that we have committed them; but when they would expound what ſorrow this ought to be, they ſpeak of it in ſuch manner as deſtroys it in effect. For they are not content to ſay, that the leaſt degree of ſorrow is ſufficient to blot out all the ſins in the world; but they do alſo maintain, that this ſorrow ought not of neceſſity to be ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and ſome proceed ſo far as to ſay, that without any true ſorrow for offending God, we may be reconciled unto him, by being only grieved that we have not the ſorrow which we ought to have.</p>

                        <hi>That there is no certain particular degree which is neceſſary.</hi> His reaſon is:

                     </p>
                     <p>God wills and demands oft in Scripture, that for obtaining pardon of ſins, we ſhould be converted unto him with all our hearts. Whence the holy Fathers have taken occaſion to ſay, that we ought not to limit or bound the grief of a ſinner who is converted, ſince it ought to be with all the affection of his heart, and that it cannot be too great nor equal the demerit and indignity of ſin. And this Jeſuit on the contrary ſaith, it muſt not be limited, becauſe it cannot be too little, and that it is always great enough to blot out ſin. See the conformity of his ſpirit with that of the holy Fathers and Scripture.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems that he would correct his errour in the anſwer which he makes a little after to this queſtion:

                        <hi>Yes, as to appretiation at leaſt.</hi> But he doth only hide his errour under the obſcurity of his words, as will appear by the explication he gives himſelf to this word <hi>Appretiation.</hi> For he ſaith that,

                        <hi>This appretiation or eſtimation proceeds not from any high degree of charity or love.</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20290"/> That is to ſay, that this ſorrow needs not be great in it ſelf, nor ariſe from any great charity; but it is ſaid to be great by reaſon the cauſe of it is great, ſince it is God, or which is the ſame thing, becauſe of the excellency of the Motive thereof; <hi>propter excellentiam motivi,</hi> or in more clear terms; becauſe God who is the Object and Motive thereof is great, though it be in it ſelf very weak and ſmall, as is alſo the Charity from whence it proceeds.</p>
                     <p>And when he ſaith, that the ſorrow for offending God ought to be <hi>appretia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> greater than all other grief which we can have for any temporal loſs, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſay no other thing then that it ought to be greater in the thought and eſteem of the ſinner, in ſuch manner that he judge and acknowledge that God is greater than all other things, and that by conſequence the loſs of God is more conſiderable than all other loſſes; though indeed this ſorrow be much leſs and more feeble in his heart than that which he hath for other loſſes and evils.

                        <hi>This is the reaſon why he may have more trouble and grief of mind for the loſs of his father or of his ſon,</hi> then for having offended God. For this hinders not but that he may believe, that God deſerves to be more loved than a <pb n="196" facs="tcp:46318:115"/>father or a ſon; and by conſequence to be more reſented when he is loſt by ſin, though in effect he have more affection for his father or for his ſon, and he be more moved by the loſs of them than by offending God: and yet in this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to this Jeſuit, he ceaſes not to be in a good eſtate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20300"/> and to obtain the pardon of his ſins, how great and in how great number ſoever they be, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he have the leaſt diſpleaſure that he hath committed them:

                     <p>He ſpeaks yet more clearly upon this Point a little after, ſaying,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20310"/> and common to good and bad, or rather proper unto them that love the world, who are ſo much more touched with regret and diſpleaſure when God takes from them their temporal goods, as they love them more: whereas good men have little or no reſentment thereof, becauſe they love them not, if their vertue be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; as appears by the Example of
<hi>Job</hi> and many others. So that this grief comes properly from the love of the world, and the adherence we have to the goods of this world: and yet according to the opinion of <hi>Hurtado</hi> the Jeſuit reported by

                     <p>This being ſo, we muſt ſay, that the world is at this day filled with perſons of great vertue and true Penitents; ſince amongſt ſo frequent and common miſeries, there are hardly any that are not afflicted with loſs of their goods, their happineſs and their repoſe, and who will not eaſily confeſs, that their ſins are the cauſe. So that according to the Rule of theſe Jeſuits, the moſt covetous, moſt ambitious, and moſt voluptuous will be the greateſt Penitents, becauſe they are more touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with regret than others for the loſs of their goods, and for having deſerved it by their ſins.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>So the Sacrament of Penance ſhall not be only altogether humane, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of parts all natural, as are confeſſion and ſorrow: but we may alſo fulfil the Command which Jeſus Chriſt hath given us to receive the Sacrament of Penance by actions meerly humane,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20350"/> yea, and unprofitable, ſince they make the Sacrament without effect, and diſordered ſince they prophane it; for it is certain, that he who knows his ſorrow for his ſins is only natural, as this Jeſuit ſuppoſes, and who confeſſeth them by a motion meerly humane and natural, tranſgreſſes the inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, as the ſame Jeſuit himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and ſins in prophaning the Sacrament, and rendring it unprofitable. So that he ſhall be acquitted of the obligation of receiving the Sacrament by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary impenitence, and by the prophanation of the Sacrament of Penance. And by conſequence the Commandments of Jeſus Chriſt as well as of the Church <pb n="198" facs="tcp:46318:116"/>may be accompliſhed by Sacriledges according to the Jeſuits, which they boldly affirm, as we ſhall ſee more at large in its place; but it is not for all that leſs horrible and incredible.</p>
                     <p>After he hath reduced ſorrow for ſin to an imaginary or meer natural being, he demands,

                        <hi>Whether it be neceſſary that this ſorrow be extended to all the ſins that are confeſſed?</hi> He anſwers preſently, according to the common opinion, that grief as well as confeſſion, ought to be extended to all ſins. But he adds to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per this Anſwer, that if the Penitent be ſorrowful only for ſome part of his ſins, and do this purpoſely, or by an ignorance that is criminal and entirely unexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that knowing his own indiſpoſition, he forbears not to perſiſt therein voluntarily, the confeſſion will be null. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20360"/>

                     <p>If we conſider <hi>Baunys</hi> diſcourſes, he will ſeem at firſt to reject this Doctrine. For in his Treatiſe of Confeſſion in his Sum, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42. <hi>pag.</hi> 674. After he had ſaid in the entrance, (3) <hi>That by the word Contrition, we underſtand one of the eſſential parts of the Sacrament, which in the propriety of its ſignification contains two things, remorſe for ſin, and a purpoſe to amend,</hi> he declares in the following page, <hi>That to the end this remorſe may be ſuch as it ought to be to make it an act of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and by conſequence an eſſential part of the Sacrament, as he ſaid at firſt, <hi>It ſhould incline him to the hatred of ſin, not for any ſhame he hath for committing it, (as the Philoſophers did heretofore) for this motive is temporal, and unprofitable to eternal life, as may be ſeen in</hi> Antiochus, 2 Maccab chap. 9. <hi>nor yet for having loſt his goods. For to be thus touched with reſentments of what is paſt, is one ſort of avarice, and very ſhameful avarice; not for having deſerved by ſinning the flames of Hell, this ſorrow is ſervile, and though it be good, though it be religious and holy, it takes its original from ſelf-love which edifies the City of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and not of God, as S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>of the City of God, chap.</hi> 28.
<hi>and therefore not compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with this action whereof we now ſpeak.</hi> Which he confirms in his Chap. 45. pag. 193. <hi>ſaying, that attrition reſpects properly his own intereſt, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good of him that acts it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may ſeem that he could not ſpeak more ſtrongly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20370"/> nor more clearly againſt the Maxims of his Fraternity; but he will quickly return to them, and he hath teſtified already little conſtancy in this very paſſage, wherein he falls into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction which manifeſtly deſtroys that which he ſeems to eſtabliſh, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth that which he ſeemeth to deſtroy.</p>
                     <p>For he declareth, <hi>That the grief we have for deſerving by ſin the pains of Hell,</hi> is not only <hi>ſervile,</hi> but doth alſo <hi>take its original from ſelf-love which edifies the City of</hi> Babylon, ſo that <hi>it comes not from God;</hi> as alſo it regards him not at all, <hi>becauſe it regards properly private intereſt, and that of him who acts it.</hi> Whence it follows evidently, that God hath not inſtituted it as an eſſential part of the Sacrament of Penance, it being impoſſible that that which comes not from God at all, and which reſpects not God at all, ſhould be inſtituted by God to ſerve to compoſe a Sacrament: that what edifies the City of the Devil, ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to edifie the City of God, as the Sacraments do; and that what takes its riſe from ſelf-love, ſhould give and produce the love of God and his grace, as the Sacraments produce it, according to all Catholicks. Which is ſo clear, that this Jeſuit himſelf hath concluded, <hi>That this ſorrow is not compatible with this action whereof we ſpeak; that is to ſay, with contrition or ſorrow, which is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the Sacrament,</hi> according to his own words.</p>
                     <p>But all this hinders not but that he ſaith at the ſame time in the ſame place, that this ſort of grief which he ſo much debaſes and rejects as an inſtrument of the City of the Devil, is good, religious, and holy, without coming from God who is the Spring of all Holineſs, all Goodneſs, and of all Religion; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20380"/> that it may be <hi>good, holy,</hi> and <hi>religious,</hi> taking its riſe from ſelf-love, which is the ſpring of all ſin and vices; and finally that it can be <hi>good, holy,</hi> and <hi>religious,</hi> edifying not the City of God, but <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is the City of the Devil, in which there is nothing but confuſion, corruption, and impiety. But this is not yet enough for <pb n="199" facs="tcp:46318:116"/>this good Jeſuit, he will make a more ample reparation to the fear of the pains of Hell, after he hath ſo much diſhonoured it. He declares in the ſame Chapter pag. 687. <hi>That the grief which hath for its object the deſerved pains of Hell is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient with the Sacrament for a mans Juſtification.</hi> He is not content to make it holy: but he makes it ſanctifying and juſtifying, and even in the Sacrament; which appertains not to many the moſt excellent and moſt perfect works. So that according to his Divinity, the fear of Hell, and the ſorrow which proceeds from it, is one of the moſt marvellous and moſt prodigious things in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, containing in it ſo many contrary qualities, whereof ſome debaſe it to the City of the Devil and to Hell, and the other elevate it unto Heaven, and give it one of the firſt ranks in the City of God, which is the Church; ſome make it prophane, and others make it religious; ſome make it impure and contagious, and the others divine and ſanctifying.</p>
                     <p>He proceeds yet farther on in favour of this ſorrow which he hath repreſented in ſo monſtrous a manner, ſaying, that even thoſe who have it not, may receive grace in the Sacrament of Penance, provided only that they deſire it, and that they are grieved that they have it not. Fourthly, ſaith he in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20390"/> pag. 685.
<hi>To ſettle a Soul in peace, who apprehends that he hath not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition which is neceſſary to the expiation of his ſins, he muſt be told that he may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that by his will to have it, or by the remorſe he hath for not poſſeſſing ſuch as he deſires to have, and ſuch as he ſhould have, perfectly to ſatisfie God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He hath taken this Maxime from <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi> who ſaith,
<note n="1" place="margin">Dolor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiens eſt cum Sacramento dolere quod non ſatis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas: itemque diſplicentia de peccato, cum propoſito; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi, et amfi diſpliceat ob timorem poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae. <hi>Sa verbo contritio. n.</hi> 5.</note> 
                        <hi>That the ſorrow which we have for not having ſorrow enough, is ſufficient with the Sacrament; as alſo diſlike of ſin with a reſolution to avoid it for time to come, though this diſlike come from the fear of puniſhment.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Whence it follows, that the fear of the pains of Hell, and the grief which it produceth, is ſo priviledged and ſo powerful amongſt the Jeſuits, that though it ariſe from a corrupt fountain of ſelf-love and the confuſion of the Devils City, yet it cannot only purifie the greateſt ſinners, and conduct them to the City of God and to Heaven; but that the wiſhing only and deſire to have it, though indeed it be not had, hath the ſame efficacy, and produces the ſame effect; not in a feeble and uncertain manner, but in the Sacrament of Penance, wherein the vertue of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt operates with an advantage which is not to be found in the moſt holy exerciſes and beſt works.</p>
                     <p>He who grieves for his ſins for fear of damnation,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20400"/> if he love not God, at the leaſt he fears him: but he that hath not this grief neither, teſtifies that he hath neither love nor fear for him; and yet he will have it, that in this eſtate he may be reconciled unto God: that is, that he may return unto God without any good motion, and come to him without making only the firſt ſtep, ſince the fear of God is the beginning of wiſdom and of a good life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bauny</hi> in the ſame place relates another opinion of ſome Caſuiſts in theſe terms:
<note n="4" place="margin">Quod ſi quis in articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo mortis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur facere quod in ſe eſt, &amp; nihil aliud occurrat quam actus attritio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis quo dicit: <hi>Domine miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere mei,</hi> cum animo placan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Deum, hic juſtificabitur ſupplente Deo abſolutionis neceſſitatem,</note> 
                        <hi>If a man being at the point of death, endeavours to do what he can; and having in his mind only an act of attrition preſent, he ſaith unto God theſe words: Lord, have mercy on me, with deſign to pacifie him, he ſhall be juſtified, God himſelf ſupplying the want of abſolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the true thought of Libertines and debauched perſons, who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to ſay when they are preſſed to be converted, and to think on death, that they need only one good <hi>Peccavi</hi> to obtain pardon for all their ſins. It is true that <hi>Bauny</hi> ſaith, that he approves not this opinion, <hi>Becauſe it is founded only on the mercy of God, and not on any good or ſolid reaſon.</hi> But it is enough to vent it into the world, that he propoſeth it as being maintained by ſome Caſuiſts; ſince that he thereby teſtifies that it is probable, and may therefore be followed with a ſafe conſcience, according to the Principles of the Divinity of his Society.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Anthony Sirmond</hi> hath been yet more bold. For he makes no bones to ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20410"/> that attrition alone, when more cannot be done, ſufficeth to deface all ſins, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:46318:117"/>be it at the point of death, or when the Sacrament is to be received or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. <hi>There are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who refer this to the extremity of life;</hi> He ſpeaks of the obligation to exerciſe the love of God; <hi>Whereunto is oppoſed the ſmall appearance that ſo great a Commandment ſhould be given us not to obey but ſo late. Neither am I of opinion to be perſwaded, that upon every reception or adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that we ought of neceſſity excite in our ſelves that holy flame of love, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume therein the ſins of which we are guilty; attrition is thereto ſufficient with ſome ſtrong endeavour after contrition, or with confeſſion when there is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nvenience for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We muſt not diſpute after this, whether attrition be ſufficient to receive the Grace of the Sacrament of Penance. This Jeſuit gives no place for this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, pretending that attrition alone is ſufficient to reſtore a man unto grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided only, <hi>That he endeavour after contrition, or that he confeſs himſelf when he hath convenience.</hi> So that for him who hath not this convenience being in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin, he maintains that attrition is ſufficient, and that he may himſelf all alone blot out his ſins, be it at the point of death, or when he comes to receive ſome Sacrament. And that he may leave no cauſe to doubt of his opinion, nor of the vertue he aſcribes to attrition, he ſaith,
<hi>That it alone is ſufficient to take away ſin.</hi> For he eſtabliſheth, as it were, two ways to return from ſin to grace; attrition alone with endeavour for contrition, and attrition with confeſſion; giving, as it were, the choice unto the ſinner of which he pleaſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20420"/> He will have it then that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition alone without the help of contrition, will ſuffice to take away ſin. He believes indeed that confeſſion is good with attrition; but it is to him <hi>that hath convenience for it.</hi> He affirms alſo, that a ſtrong endeavour after contrition is commendable; <hi>but he is not of opinion to believe that we ought of neceſſity excite in our ſelves this holy flame of love, to conſume therein the ſin whereof we are guilty.</hi> He confeſſes that this is the beſt expedient, the moſt ſafe and perfect; but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that we may diſpenſe with it, <hi>and that attrition is ſufficient thereto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is remarkable that he ſpeaks of attrition in the ſelf ſame ſenſe as Father <hi>Bauny,</hi> though it be not entirely in the ſelf ſame terms. For he ſpeaks of attrition which ariſeth from ſelf-love, and which is without any love of God, as his words evidently teſtifie: <hi>I am not of opinion to believe that we ought of neceſſity excite in our ſelves this holy flame of love, to conſume therein the ſin whereof we are guilty.</hi> He excludes then the obligation and neceſſity of exciting in us the love of God to deſtroy mortal ſin. So that when he ſaith, that attrition is ſufficient, he intends that attrition which is without the love of God: the attrition and regret for offending God, which takes it riſe from love of ones ſelf, and not of God, as <hi>Bauny</hi> ſaith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dicaſtillus</hi> extends alſo the effect of this attrition yet farther. For he ſaith, that this alone is ſufficient to cauſe that one may ſuffer Martyrdom; that death and torments undergone, not through a Principle of Charity and Love of God; but only through fear, are capable to juſtifie and make everlaſtingly happy the greateſt ſinners. There is not then any remedy more univerſal than attrition, by the opinion of theſe Fathers; ſince, as we have now made appear, it hath ſo many different effects, Martyrdom it ſelf not being excepted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20430"/> which we hitherto believed to have been an effect of love, and that not of any ſort neither, but ſtrong and powerful; <hi>majorem charitatem.</hi> We muſt not only ſay of this fear altogether earthly and ſervile, what the Scripture faith indeed of the moſt noble: <hi>Initium ſapientiae timor: Fear is the beginning of wiſdom:</hi> but we ought alſo to add; <hi>Conſummatio ſapientiae timor: Fear is the compleating of wiſdom;</hi> ſince it cauſeth us to produce the moſt Heroick act of Chriſtian Religion, and conducts us even into Glory; <hi>ad conferendam gratiam &amp; gloriam:</hi> and contrary to what the Apoſtle ſaith; When my body is in the midſt of flames, if at the ſame time my heart be not inflamed with this heavenly fire of divine love, all theſe torments are unto me unprofitable: <hi>Si tradidero corpus meum ita ut ardeam, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem autem non habeam, mihi nihil prodeſt: If I give my body to be burnt, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.</hi> This Jeſuit would have it that death which the Philoſophers call <hi>terribilium terribiliſſmum,</hi> ſufficeth with attrition on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that is to ſay, by the motive of fear alone, and without any mixture of love, <pb n="201" facs="tcp:46318:117"/>it is capable to purge away all blemiſhes, and to beſtow glory on the moſt crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perſon of the whole world; <hi>ad conferendam gratiam &amp; gloriam.</hi>

                        <hi>That the Jeſuits do destroy the integrity thereof.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe ſinner in Confeſſion is as a ſick Patient, who preſents himſelf to the Prieſt as to his Phyſitian, and diſcovers unto him his ſickneſs, that he may appoint him the remedies which he ſhall judge neceſſary for the healing and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Soul. For this cauſe he ought to be faithful, and make him ſee the bottom of his heart, not contenting himſelf only to tell him his ſins piece-meal, and to ſpecifie as much as he can their number and their circumſtances; but alſo by noting out to him the paſſions unto which he is ſubject, and the evil habits which have been the ſources of theſe diſorders. The Divinity of the Jeſuits di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts men from acquitting themſelves ſincerely in this duty, and from fulfilling the integrity of confeſſion in all points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Bauny</hi> ſaith, <hi>That if any one of ignorance and ſimplicity confeſs his faults only in groſs, without determinately expreſſing any one in particular, there's no need to draw from his mouth the repetition of thoſe faults, if it cannot conveniently be done, becauſe [the Confeſſor] is preſſed with Penitents that give him not leiſure for it.</hi> In his Sum, Chap. 40. pag. 650.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Confeſſor then, as often as he finds himſelf preſſed with Penitents, muſt preſently become a Prophet, to diſcover of himſelf the ſins which are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him but in general, and to preſcribe the true remedies by a light extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and which comes immediately from God; or elſe he muſt deal with his Penitent at adventure, as a Phyſitian that being not at leiſure to confider his ſick Patient, diſpatches him in haſte, and appoints him the firſt thing that comes in his mind; without having taken ſo much pains as to inform himſelf of the particularities of his ſickneſs, becauſe he hath many other Patients to viſit, who will not ſuffer him to ſtay with this, and look to him more nearly; and in the mean time he would perſwade him that he is cured, and that he may return to his ordinary employments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bauny</hi> propoſes a ſecond caſe like to the former. He demands, <hi>What is fit to be ſaid to them who in their youth have done many actions vicious in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which notwithſtanding they believed not to be ſuch?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>That they are not obliged to ſay one word of them when they apprehend and know their nature and conditions; and much leſs to repeat their paſt Confeſſions.</hi> He ſeems to have a deſign to oppoſe himſelf to the word of the Prophet, who beſeeches God not to remember the ſins of his youth and of his ignorance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20480"/> acknowledging them to be true ſins, and that he ought to ask pardon for them of God, though he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them by ignorance: and this Jeſuit on the contrary will that they be not confeſt, nor pardon asked for them from God, as if they were innocent actions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dicaſtillus</hi> propoſes one caſe very like this:

                        <hi>That he frees Penitents from examining their conſciences, at the leaſt ſo exactly, although it may well fall out,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that by examining your ſelf more exactly, you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome new ſins, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20490"/> you are not thereunto obliged for all that.</hi> It were even to be wiſht for Penitents, that they had bad memories, that they might before God be diſcharged of their ſins without the Sacrament of Confeſſion. If you ſay to this Jeſuit, that the Penitent may relieve his memory by ſetting down his ſins in writing, he will anſwer you, that he is not obliged thereunto. If you add, that having of en cauſe to diſtruſt his memory, he may go frequently to Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he will give you the ſame anſwer: and ſo it may oftentimes come to paſs, that a Penitent of this ſort covered with ſins, may caſt himſelf at the feet of a Prieſt as an innocent, without accuſing himſelf of any crime, though he have indeed a Soul altogether polluted there with, becauſe he hath been ſo happy as to have a wretched memory.</p>

He makes uſe of two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſons.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20500"/>
                        <hi>That otherwiſe many Confeſſions muſt be refuſed.</hi> That is to ſay, that we are not to trouble our ſelves to remedy a miſchief, becauſe it is too great, and that if it were not ſo univerſal, it were good to oppoſe it, by obliging thoſe who had forgot their ſins to confeſs them the firſt time; but that this is not now neceſſary; though the forgetfulneſs or ignorance which is the cauſe of this omiſſion of ſins, and which cauſeth them to commit this ſin, be malicious and criminal: <hi>licet ignorantia ſit culpabilis mortaliter.</hi> In regard that this abuſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo common, that the greater part of thoſe who confeſs themſelves, doing it without great reſentment and without much preparation forget frequently one part of their ſins; and ſo there would be too much trouble to the Confeſſors and Penitents to repeat their Confeſſions ſo ill made. This is that which he ſaith clearly in his ſecond reaſon, with which he concludes in theſe terms. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we were to follow the contrary opinion in practice,</hi> which obliges to repeat an imperfect Confeſſion, <hi>this would make the burden of Confeſſion too heavy.</hi>

                        <hi>It is altogether certain,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that in confeſſion thoſe circumſtances are neceſſarily to be expreſſed which change the kind of the ſin; becauſe they joyn there to a new moral wickedneſs.</hi> Heasks, <hi>If the ſame thing muſt be affirmed of them which aggravate and augment it notably?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>That ſuch is the opinion of Suarez.</hi> But he holds the contrary with <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> His reaſon is, becauſe we are not obliged by the Precept of Confeſſion but only to declare all mortal ſins; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20520"/> which may be done without diſcovering theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, though they make the ſin notably greater. So that according to him, whatſoever theft a man have committed, it ſuffices unto a good confeſſion thereof to ſay:

                        <hi>I have ſinned ſo often in the matter of theft, without expreſſing the quantity of the theft.</hi> I might here inſiſt a little upon this, to repreſent how this Maxime deſtroys the integrity and ſincerity of confeſſion, and at the ſame time cheriſheth theft, not obliging him who hath ſtoln ten thouſand Crowns to accuſe himſelf otherwiſe than he who hath ſtoln ten. But he that propounds this deſtroys it himſelf, teaching the quite contrary, and proving it by a ſolid reaſon in Chap. 5. of his Sum, pag. 68. where he ſaith, <hi>That it ſufficeth not the Penitent to acquit himſelf of his duty, to ſay to his Confeſſor, that he hath ſtoln in a notable quantity to offend mortally, if he do not rate and ſpecifie unto him the ſum, becauſe he ought to know the eſtate of his Penitent; which he cannot eaſily do, if he unfold not to him the quantity of the theft.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if any would object unto this good Father this ſo manifeſt contradiction, he will believe that he is diſcharged thereof by ſaying that both the opinions are probable, becauſe there are Authors for the one and for the other; and as we may follow both, ſo we may teach both.</p>

                     <p>ABſolution is a Judgment which the Prieſt pronounceth on Gods behalf in favour of the Penitent, by which he forgives him his ſins, after the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance which he hath received from himſelf, of the remedies which he hath apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the good effects and holy diſpoſitions which they have produced in him to eſtabliſh him in the Grace of God.</p>
                     <p>The Divinity of the Jeſuits ruines this part of the Sacrament of Penance, as well as the other, taking from the Prieſt the authority and quality of a Judge and Superior, and ſubjects him to the Penitent, in ſuch manner, that he muſt follow him in the Judgment that he ought to make of his ſins and of his eſtate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20700"/> and of his diſpoſition to receive abſolution, and obliging him to bear himſelf according to what he ſays and wills, and to give him abſolution as oft as he demands it, though the Confeſſor judge him unworthy and intirely uncapable thereof.</p>
                     <p>From theſe Maxims it is that <hi>Bauny</hi> in his Sum, Chap. 45. pag. 702. ſaith, that the Confeſſor before he abſolve the Penitent, ſhall examine him if he have no more to ſay; if he be ſorry with all his heart for offending God; if he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſerve him well and faithfully for the time to come, by a voiding all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin, which being ſaid thus univerſally and in common, is ſufficient for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sacramental abſolution.</p>

<hi>If notwithſtanding all that they have ſaid and promiſed in times paſt to their Confeſſor, they cannot forbear to break out into exceſs and greater liberty in the very ſame faults as before, they ought to be admitted to the Sacrament, and may be abſolved?</hi> He ſaith firſt, that there are ſome who hold, that abſolution ought to be deferred for ſome time: but in the proceſs he makes this queſtion: He who ſhould do the contrary, ſhould he ſin? To which he anſwers clearly in two words:
<hi>That is not my opinion.</hi> And at laſt he concludes in this manner:
<hi>That the Penitent purpoſing with true affection, and reſorting to the feet of the Prieſt to put an end unto his ſins, dignus eſt abſolutione toties quoties, deſerves to receive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, quantumcunque nulla notetur emendatio, though he amend not.</hi> He is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſay, that abſolution may be given to this man, he pretends that it may not be refuſed him, ſince he deſerves it, <hi>dignus eſt;</hi> and that though he relapſe every day into the ſame crimes, in caſting himſelf only at the feet of the Prieſt, and ſaying to him, that he hath a deſire to be reformed, he ſhall deſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive abſolution every day and, more frequently, if he deſire it, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> though he relapſe immediately, without ever being amended; <hi>quantumcunque nulla notetur emendatio.</hi>

                        <hi>I anſwer that he is not abſorutely his Superior, and that he hath not a right to command him in all things; but only in what hath reference to the ſins wherewith he charges himſelf at the Tribunal of Penance</hi> To ſpeak this in more clear terms, the Confeſſor ought indeed to pronounce the Sentence of Abſolution on the Penitent; but he is to take it from the mouth of the ſame Penitent, like a Cryer that publiſheth the Decree of ſome Court. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20760"/> Becauſe the Penitent who appears before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Penance as the Malefactor, is alſo the witneſs in his own affair, and his own chief Judge: that it belongs to him to inquire after his ſins, to examine them, and to judge of their greatneſs and of the puniſhment which they deſerve; that having done this, there remains nothing for him to do but to preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the Prieſt, and to caſt himſelf down at his feet to confeſs himſelf, and that accuſing himſelf for his ſins, he hath nothing elſe to do but to preſent unto him his proceſs already made up with his Judgment, to the end that he may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, as it is already concluded and decreed.</p>
                     <p>I ſee very well that the Confeſſor is not abſolutely nor in all things ſuperior to the Penitent, as this Jeſuit ſaith, but only in what reſpects the ſins which he hath confeſſed. But in what conſiſts this ſuperiority, if the Penitent having diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his faults, he ought not to refer it to the light of the Confeſſor to judge of the quality of his ſins, the convenient remedies, and the time neceſſary to heal them, and of his diſpoſition to receive abſolution? For if in every of theſe points, and particularly in that which preſuppoſeth and contains them all, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the Confeſſor ought to ſubmit to the opinion and will of the Penitent, he is no more his Superior in what reſpects even thoſe ſins of which the Penitent hath accuſed himſelf. It is the Penitent who is true Superior, and the Confeſſor holds the place of an Inferior on his part, ſince he is bound to obey him and follow
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46318:124"/>his opinion againſt his own. Which comes all to one with what I have already obſerved, that upon this ſuppoſition that the Confeſſor pronounceth Sentence of Abſolution, taking it from the mouth of the Penitent, as a publick Cryer doth from the mouth of a Chief Juſtice of ſome Court; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20770"/> and by conſequence the Confeſſor is not the Judge but the Cryer, and abſolution is only a ſimple decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of <hi>Layman</hi> were probable, if it might be ſaid, that a Judge were obliged to refer himſelf to the judgment of the Malefactor, ſending him back abſolved when he pleaſes, though according to the Laws he deſerved death; or a Phyſitian that of his Patient, treating him as a ſound man becauſe he deſires it, and becauſe he is not ſenſible of his diſeaſe, though the Phyſitian believe he is in danger of death. For this is in effect that which <hi>Layman</hi> pretends, when he ſaith, that a Confeſſor who is truly a Judge and a Phyſitian, is obliged to give abſolution to a Penitent, becauſe he demands it, though the Confeſſor be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he is not in an eſtate to receive it:

                        <hi>this law of Charity which is due to our ſelves or God, is not violated herein: for though the ſinner defer ſatisfaction until the next life, he loſes not by this, neither bliſs nor the love of God; and though he retard the enjoyment thereof, yet the loſs made by this delay may be repaired.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that none are obliged to do Penance in this world, and Jeſus Chriſt ought not to threaten them who do it not with a death like unto theirs, who were overwhelmed and preſſed to death by the fall of a Tower, becauſe it is lawful to defer it till after death; and ſo they who will not do it here being not guilty, they have no cauſe to fear any thing becauſe of this from God who doth not puniſh the innocent.</p>
                     <p>I ſtay not here to examine the reaſons of this Jeſuite, that I may not be too tedious. I ſay only that the principle which he eſtabliſheth that,
<note n="4" place="margin">Dico 1. non videri da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſſe tale praeceptum de ſatisfaciendo in hac vita pro poena tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali.</note>
                        <hi>according to his judgment there is no natural precept which obliges us in this life to make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for temporal pains,</hi> without doubt takes away all footing for all doubts and difficulties which might ariſe on this ſubject; but withal it entirely abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth ſatisfaction and Penance by taking away the obligation to do it in this life; which is that I have affirmed to be amongſt thoſe points of the Jeſuits Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity which I have undertaken to diſcover.</p>
                     <p>I adde that by deſtroying Penance, he ruines at the ſame time the whole Goſpel which began by Preaching Penance, and contains in effect no other thing, ſince the whole life of a Chriſtian is nothing elſe but a continual Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, according to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and all the Fathers.</p>
                     <p>So we ſee that all the places of the Scripture and of the Fathers which ſpeak of Penance are addreſſed to the living;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20990"/> and it would be very hard to find any directed to the dead, and which commands or counſels them to do Penance for their ſins; the Scripture and the Church having always taught until this time that it is impoſſible, becauſe it is impoſſible to faſt after death, to weep, to wear Sackcloth and Aſhes, and to do other like Exerciſe, in which the Scripture it ſelf and the Church it ſelf have eſtabliſhed the Penance and ſatisfaction which we owe unto God for our ſins: <hi>Emandemus in melius quae ignoranter peccavimus, nè ſubito praeoccupati die mortis quaeramus ſpatium poenitentiae, &amp; invenire non poſſimus.

                           </note> When a great ſinner confeſſeth himſelf, they hold that he needs not give himſelf the trouble to inform of all the particularities of his life and crimes, and that the more he is laden with ſins, he is the more ſlightly and leſs exactly to be examined. And behold the reaſon: The examination muſt be ſuch as may not <pb n="224" facs="tcp:46318:129"/>beget a diſguſt of the Sacrament. Whence it follows that we muſt exact a leſs perfect knowledge of him, who for the multitude of his ſins or ſome other cauſe can difficultly render an exact account: That if he be a Thief, it is ſufficient for him to ſay, I have ſinned mortally in the matter of theft, without expreſſing any farther the ſum which he ſtole: If he be a debauched and wicked perſon, it is not needful to preſs him to tell the number of the diſhoneſt thoughts and deſires which he hath had, though he might do it eaſily, that it ſufficeth that he ſay for example; <hi>I loved</hi> Mary <hi>a whole month, toto menſe amavi Mariam:</hi> That it belongs to the Confeſſor to ſupply and divine the reſt; and that he ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this rule in other ſins:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21030"/> That if the Penitent have omitted in his Confeſſion any ſin which he believes probably to be no ſin, the Confeſſor cannot oblige him to diſcover it, becauſe of two probable opinions the Penitent may chuſe whether he pleaſeth: and if the Penitent believes more than probably, if he be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it is a ſin, provided he believe probably that he hath confeſſed it, the Confeſſor cannot oblige him to accuſe himſelf of it; and all this is true, though he believe more probably that he hath ſinned mortally, or that he hath not confeſſed it at all,</p>
                        <p>If this ſinner ſignifie that he would make a general Confeſſion, he is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to declare the ſins he hath already confeſt, and thoſe which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſince his laſt Confeſſion; and if his Confeſſor pretend to oblige him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, this would be very frivolouſly done, for he might receive his anſwer from the Penitent in theſe words: I accuſe my ſelf of this ſin, whether I have or have not confeſſed it already, I am not obliged to confeſs more unto you. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21040"/> And this is true, though he make ſuch a medley of new and old ſins, with deſign to hide from the Confeſſor the time when he committed theſe new crimes, becauſe he hath a right to do ſo. The Confeſſor is not obliged to examine him whether he have told him all, and whether he have forgotten any ſin; becauſe the Penitent, though he have declared that he would make a Confeſſion of all the ſins of his life, may omit what he pleaſeth without any lye; and if this be any kind of lye, it is but a venial one. This opinion is certain and commonly received in the Schools.</p>

So that the inſolencies which are committed inwardly before him, are no leſs known unto him, and are no leſs criminal, than thoſe which are externally committed before men.

                  <p>According to this Maxime, if <hi>Herod</hi> had ſecretly killed Jeſus Chriſt whilſt he adored him, as he contrived his deſign when he learnt of the Wiſe-men that he was born, and if he had obſerved all the Forms and all the outward Ceremonies of adoration, at the ſame time giving only ſome ſignal unto his people to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Infant, as
<hi>Judas</hi> ſaluting and kiſſing the ſame Jeſus Chriſt with outward reſpect, and ordinary teſtimonies of affection which he ought him, marked him out to the Souldiers who were come to take him; this Jeſuit might have ſaid of this Tyrant killing Jeſus Chriſt in the very act of adoration, and of <hi>Judas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying him by a kiſs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28280"/> that which he ſaith of Eccleſiaſticks and Chriſtians offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God mortally in prayer;

                     <hi>That the act of adoration and ſalutation, as well as that of prayer, which is done with all the outward circumſtances which ought to be had, is a true outward action of Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſuch a religious action was never heard of before, and that it is a difficult thing even ſo much as to conceive this ſort of adoration, he expounds it by an example quite contrary.
<note n="3" place="margin">Sicut ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio externa in Idolo facta, eſt verè actus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae, etſi illum exercens inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius non inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat adorare I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolum. <hi>Ibid. n.</hi> 296. 3 <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in his Sum, Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>pag.</hi> 176.</note>

                  <p>It might ſeem at firſt ſight that this is the utmoſt point of diſorder whereunto it were poſſible to fall in this matter; but Father <hi>Bauny</hi> deſcends yet lower. He demands, <hi>if the Chanons fulfil their duty, and earn their dividends, who being aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in the Quire during holy Service, paſs their time in ſcandalous diſcourſe, and in employment altogether vicious, as in laughing, ſcoffing, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21290"/> in doing and ſaying other things which we dare not expreſs openly, and which yet is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in what he ſaith, <hi>that they paſs their time in an employment altogether vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi> Though he concludes not for the affirmative, yet for all that he teſtifies ſufficiently that it rather ſhame and fear of men that hinders him from declaring himſelf, and he makes it well appear that he is not far off from this opinion, in that he contents not himſelf only to report and propoſe it as probable, and to ſay, that we may follow and adviſe it with a ſafe conſcience; which is truly to approve it: but he approves it yet more formally by ſupporting it with all the reaſons he can. See here how he talks: <hi>Becauſe we are not aſſured of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, and that the Texts of c.</hi> 1. <hi>de Cler. non res......of c. Licet</hi> 32.
<hi>of the title de Prebend. make no mention ſave of their aſſiſtance in the Quire, and becauſe the cuſtom every where received exacts of the Chanons no other thing that they may receive their dividends, but that they be preſent, I eſteem them without blame and reproach, who in favour of their Penitents hold this ſecond opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are four reaſons to be obſerved, upon which he concludes that they are not reproachable, who maintain that the Chanons ſatisfie their duty as far as the Church obligeth them therein, and earn their dividends by aſſiſting in the Quire with irreverence, and that even outward alſo, <hi>by laughing, ſcoffing, and ſpending their time in employments altogether vicious.</hi> 1.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46318:134"/>in this ſort, and to ſay that we may pray to him and ſerve him in ſo prophane and unworthy a manner.</p>
                  <p>His fourth reaſon is, <hi>becauſe we are not aſſured,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the intention of the Church.</hi> It is apparent that he hath taken this reaſon from <hi>Filliutius,</hi> who to confirm the opinion which he holds, that whatſoever voluntary diſtractions we can have in prayer, and in the divine Office, there is therein no more than venial ſin, makes uſe of this very ſame reaſon. For after he had brought for proof of this opinion,
<note n="1" place="margin">Quia ſatis accommodata eſt hominum ſragilitati &amp; difficultati quam humanus intellectus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritur in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendendo diu uni rei.</note> 
                     <hi>that it is ſufficiently accommodate to mens frailty, and to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of holding the ſpirit of man a long time attentive to one object;</hi> he adds,

                  </p>
                  <p>Now if theſe Jeſuits had ſaid as ſome of their Fraternity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21310"/> that the Church had not power to forbid the greateſt part of theſe things, which reſpect the thoughts; though their opinion had been falſe, it had for all that been leſs crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and leſs injurious to the Church. For to ſay, that it cannot command us to pray to God with reverence and attention, is to hurt its Authority: but to ſay, that it is not its intention, or that it would not, or only to doubt whether ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power it would, and whether it deſires we ſhould bear that reverence and attention which God demands in prayer, is to violate its Holineſs, to give it an intention far diſtant from that of God, to deny that it is guided by the Spirit, and to make it accomptable for all the crimes which are committed in this kind; becauſe having power it forbids them not, as <hi>Filliutius</hi> and <hi>Bauny</hi> ſuppoſe. For otherwiſe it were in vain that they ſhould trouble themſelv es to know its inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and will in a point which depends not at all on its will.</p>
                  <p>But though there were ſome one to be found who might doubt of this, or who of groſs ignorance knew not the intention of the Church in this matter, it is not lawful for Father <hi>Bauny</hi> to make uſe of this pretence to favour an opinion which leads unto Libertiniſm and Irreligion, and we need not ſeek more clear teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to deſtroy this errour than his own, ſince he declares in Chap. 20. of his Sum, pag. 332. <hi>That being true devotion is in the heart, and not in the carriage, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in the faſhion and other outward geſture, and that this pretended devotion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out is but a vizor and an Idol of devotion; it is a reſolved caſe, that in the voluntary diſtraction and wandring of the mind in praying by obligation, as do Prieſts, Deacons and Subdeacons, and Beneficiaries, there is ſin; and ſo they are obliged to repeat the Office which they have ſaid with ſo great indevotion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21320"/> For the will of the Church is, that by this action which it commands them they ſhould praiſe and pray unto God their Creator. And do they this whilſt they have nothing leſs during their ſinging, than God before their eye? They ought then to fulfil their duty begin the Office again, and in default thereof, if they be Beneficiaries they are bound to reſtore either to the Church where their Benefice is, or to the poor the fruits they have received, according to the rate of their omiſſions, as may be collected from the Bull of</hi> Pius V.</p>
                  <p>He purſues the ſame matter, and declares once more in the ſame place what is the intention of the Church in the Command which it give Eccleſiaſticks and Beneficiaries to recite the Office. <hi>The Church intends not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to make the Eccleſiaſticks, Poſſeſſors of the fruits of their ſaid Benefice, if they earn it not by their labour. The diſpoſure thereof is conditional, if they perform the prayers with which they are charged, doing them to the praiſe and honour of God. And can we ſay with truth that they deſerve to be his ſervants, or put into the rank of thoſe who render him the worſhip which his Majeſty requires of them, when they have their lips only occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in his ſervice, and not their heart, becauſe it is filled with unprofitable thoughts
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46318:135"/>and very remote from the greatneſs of his Majeſty to whom they ſpeak?</hi> pag. 333.</p>
                  <p>He had already ſaid the ſame thing in Chap. 13. pag. 165. where he makes of it a concluſion, promoting it not only as his opinion, but alſo as a manifeſt and certain thing. 2. Saith he, <hi>The ſaid Beneficiaries are obliged to make reſtitution of the fruits received from their Benefices when they ſay their hours, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21330"/> but imperfectly with voluntary diſtraction which endures throughout the whole Office or the greater part thereof.</hi> And after he had cited many Authors who are of this opinion, he gives this reaſon for it: <hi>Becauſe that not to recite their hours at all, or to do it inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently with out reſpect, attention and reverence, is all one before God, ſince he is equally deſpiſed and diſhonoured in both,</hi> pag. 165.</p>
                  <p>Can we ſpeak more clearly or more abſolutely on this ſubject? <hi>It is a reſolved caſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that prayer which is made without attention is but a vizor and an Idol of devetion; that the Eccleſiaſticks and Beneficiaries who recite the Office with volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary wandring and diſtraction of mind are obliged to begin it anew, and in default of doing this they are bound to reſtore the fruits received: that the will of the Church is, that by this action which it commands them they ſhould praiſe and pray unto their Creator: That the Church doth not intend to make the ſaid Eccleſiaſticks Poſſeſſors of the fruits of their ſaid Benefices, but on the condition that they pray unto God, praiſe and honour him: that they honour him not at all, but rather diſhonour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn him when they have only their lips occupied in his ſervice, and not their hearts, becauſe it is filled with unprofitable thoughts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who would not ſay after this, that this Father is ſo perſwaded of theſe things, that he holds them almoſt for Articles of Faith, or at leaſt for indubitable truths, whereto the whole world ought to conſent? And who would believe that he could ſay at the ſame time,
<hi>That we are not aſſured of the intention of the Church upon the ſame things: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21340"/> that he could imagine that they were without reproach and blame who hold, that Beneficiaries and Chanons ſatisfie their duties, and earn their dividends, who aſſiſting in the Quire during the holy Service, paſs their time in ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous diſcourſe, and in an employment altogether vicious, as in langhing, ſcoffing, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which of the two opinions of this Jeſuit ought we to hold; or rather how ſhall we know which is his opinion, what he ſaith, and what he thinks? He ſaith all, and he ſaith nothing, becauſe he unſays and contradicts himſelf. He is of what opinion you pleaſe, and he is of none. But if mens laſt words be more conſiderable than their firſt, and if we may rely on them as their laſt reſolution, there is cauſe to believe that this Father hath related ſo clearly the judgment and intention of the Church concerning the abuſe of thoſe who pray and recite the Office without intention and without reſpect, only to overturn it, and to teſtifie the little account he makes of it, becauſe he hath confidence a little after to ſay, that we may prudently preſume that <hi>it was not the will of the Church to oblige Prieſts, Beneficiaries, and others to the divine Office with ſo great, ſeverity, that they ſin mortally, if they have not an inward attention thereunto; ſince it ſeems not in its precept for reciting the hours, to erect any other thing of the Prieſts and others who are bound thereunto, but to honour and praiſe God; which they do in ſinging Pſalms and chaunting, though with voluntary diſtraction, and in which they continue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that this be done, and they ſing tunably and with reverence,</hi> pag. 534.</p>
                  <p>But the Argument he makes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21350"/> and the Example he brings to eſtabliſh his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and to confirm this ſtrange Opinion, is remarkable. <hi>For the outward action,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>wherewith we attend on God, is of the Dioceſs, and an appurtenance of the vertue of Religion. Wherefore as he who without intention to commit Idolatry, bends his knee before an Idol, is held for an Idolater nevertheleſs: ſo we muſt believe that they pray who recite the Office, though without intention, yet not without outward decency and compoſure, ſuch as that action requires,</hi> pag. 335:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coninck</hi> makes uſe of the ſame Reaſoning and the ſame Example in this ſame matter, as we have ſeen above, and there is cauſe to believe that Father <hi>Bauny</hi> hath only copied and tranſlated him: but the one and the other ought to have called to mind that it is much eaſier to do harm than good; and that what is evil in it ſelf is always evil, to what intention ſoever it be done. But to do good
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46318:135"/>it is not ſufficient to do a thing which is good in it ſelf, if it be not well done, that is, with good intention, according to this Rule: <hi>Bona bene agenda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſoning which Father <hi>Bauny</hi> takes up at length upon this Point, is as falſe and ridiculous as his Example. <hi>And that this is true,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>may be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from this, that it imports not a little to the glory of God, that we addreſs our ſelves to him with outward reſpect, which edifies the people, and obtains his favours from Heaven, whereto prayers are uſeful, though ſaid without attention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We need not ſeek Reaſons to make appear the extravagance of theſe words; it is ſufficient to make it known, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21360"/> to repreſent what the ſame Jeſuit, puſht on by the force of the truth, ſaith, Chap. 16. pag. 165. <hi>That not to recite the hours at all, and not to do it decently, is all one before God, ſince he is equally diſhonoured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned in both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he hath advanced theſe ſo ſtrange Maxims which overturn Religion and Prayer, which is as it were the firſt-fruits and moſt common exerciſe thereof; and after he hath eſtabliſhed theſe Maxims by ſuch Reaſons and ſuch Examples, he draws from thence practical Concluſions as pernicious, which he beſtows on Confeſſors and Directors, to ſerve them as a Rule in the conduct of Souls, and in the reſolution of all doubts and difficulties which may be propoſed unto them in this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>According hereunto,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Confeſſor ſhall not reprove his Penitent as for any mortal fault, for having applied his mind to frivelous things, ſo long as his tongue reſounded the praiſes of God with others in the Church, if in outward appearance he did nothing that was incompatible with this action,</hi> pag. 335.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſhall not oblige him to the repetition of any thing ſaid in that manner, ſince in pronouncing them in that ſort he hath fulfilled the precept, nor yet to make reſtitution of the fruits received from his Benefice, if he have any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which very thing he himſelf condemns but two pages before, ſaying, <hi>That Eccleſiaſticks who pray with voluntary diſtraction and wandring minds, ought for the performance of their duty, begin their Office anew; and in default of ſo doing, if Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiaries, they are bound to reſtore unto the Church where their Benefice is, or to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or the fruits received according to the rate of their omiſſions, as he collects from the Bull of</hi> Pius V.</p>
                  <p>So his mind appears floating betwixt errour and truth, which dazles his eyes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21370"/> and conſtrains him to acknowledge and confeſs it; and it would be hard to judge what may be concluded of Propoſitions ſo different and contrary, if he did not himſelf diſcover throughout his Book a deſign he hath to let the Reins looſe unto the corrupt inclinations of Nature, and to give men liberty to follow their deſires and luſts, as well in Civil as Religious matters. For there is nothing but the conſideration of men, and the fear of ſcandal that holds him back a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and hinders him from doing it ſo openly; and this fear and this carriage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages him continually in theſe manifeſt contrarieties which are inevitable unto thoſe who would flatter men and corrupt the truth.</p>
                  <p>Here would be a proper place to ſpeak of the Diſpenſations which the Jeſuits give Eccleſiaſticks from reciting the Office upon Reaſons ſo ſlight, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ridiculous, that they themſelves unto whom this obligation ſeems moſt grievous and troubleſom, durſt not demand them, if they did not by offering them unto them, prevent them, and in ſome ſort force them to receive them, by aſſuring them, that they may make uſe of them with a ſafe conſcience, though their own, altogether corrupt as it is, reproach them for it, and that the light of Nature only ſuffices to diſcover that they ought not do it. But becauſe we have already produced ſome in the Treatiſe of Probability for Example ſake, I will content my ſelf to add only one more here in this place out of <hi>Tambourin,</hi> who ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21380"/>

But becauſe this Point is more ſubtle, and I have ſpoken thereof already before, I will not inſiſt on it here, contenting my ſelf to make appear, that they excuſe and juſtifie thoſe who do no good Works at all, though they be able, teſtifying unto them, that they are not bound thereunto; and by this means they divert men from the practice of them, removing from them the obligation, and aboliſhing the Commandment as much as in them lyes.</p>

This is, to ſpeak properly, to diſcharge men from the obligation of giving alms, theſe extream neceſſities never falling out in a manner, and there being few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſee any ſuch in many years, or not at all in their whole lives: and when ſuch an one by great accident is preſented, we are not obliged any farther to provide for them, according to theſe Doctors, if we have not wealth to ſpare, and riches that are ſuperfluous; and there being hardly any perſon who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he hath ſuch, or who indeed hath ſuch, ſo much doth Covetouſneſs, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, Houſe-keeping rack men at this day, and makes all men in a manner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous; ſo the obligation of giving alms ſhall be aboliſhed, and there ſhall hardly be any perſon found who ſhall think himſelf obliged to aſſiſt his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to what neceſſity ſoever he be reduced.</p>

                  <p>But if it be lawful in this manner to oppoſe the new Divines to the ancient Tradition in this Article, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21470"/> and in this oppoſition to prefer the Judgment of the Caſuiſts before that of the holy Fathers, inſtead of judging and correcting the Moderns by the Tradition of Antiquity; it will be lawful to do the ſame thing in all other Points which concern Manners or Religion; and ſo there ſhall be nothing fixed in the Doctrine of the Church, and Antiquity ſhall be no more a mark of Truth and Faith; but Novelty ſhall be more conſiderable, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this preſent it hath paſſed for a Vice and a mark of Errour.</p>
                  <p>But for all that he hath over-reached in ſaying that this new Opinion which he holds is the common and unanimous of the School-men, he having himſelf acknowledged at his firſt ſetting out, that S.
<hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Cajetan</hi> were not for it, who are not of the leaſt conſideration; and no more is it that of others, the more ancient School-men eſpecially; which doth the more heighten his exceſs. For if all the School-men had been of one and the ſame advice upon this Point, that of the holy Fathers being contrary to theirs, it would without doubt be a great raſhneſs to quit the Fathers to follow the new School-men. But theſe being divided upon this Point, and the Saints on the contrary being all of one and the ſame Judgment, ſo that there is not one ſingle one who therein contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the reſt, the inſolence and preſumption appears yet more inſupportable, to prefer the opinion of one part of the new Divines to the common and univerſal Judgment of the holy Fathers, and one part alſo even of the moſt famous School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>The Jeſuits then hold, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21480"/> that the Rich are not obliged to give alms but only of their ſupenfluity, and they will not oblige them thereunto neither but in caſe of great neceſſity.

                     <hi>All this which I have related,</hi> ſaith this Father, <hi>makes us ſee that a man extreamly poor may ſteal precious things, and that by conſequence the Rich is obliged to give him them. But becauſe the contrary opinion is alſo probable, the Rich may purſue him, and not give his Riches to the Poor: not that this war can be juſt on both ſides ſpeaking abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; but it is ſo by vertue of two probable opinions; which is no inconvenience, as we do all teach.</hi> He calls the combat which is betwixt the cruelty of the Rich who refuſes to give alms unto the Poor, and the infidelity of the Poor which prompts him to ſteal from the Rich, a war. I confeſs that he hath reaſon for this, as well as for that he acknowledges that this war cannot be abſolutely juſt on both ſides, ſince cruelty as well as theft is a kind of injuſtice. And he gives alſo teſtimony to the truth without thinking thereof, and deſtroys his own proper cauſe by adding that this war between the Poor and the Rich, or rather betwixt cruelty and theft, being unjuſt of it ſelf, is nevertheleſs made juſt by vertue of two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinions which maintain it; one, that the Rich is not bound to give alms to the Poor, and the other, that the Poor may ſteal from the Rich. This is the uſe and particular advantage of this marvellous Science of Probability, according to this Jeſuit, who is one of its principal Defenders, to be able to juſtifie crimes by aboliſhing the Commandments of God and the Exerciſe of good Works.</p>

                     <hi>It ſeems that amongſt Chriſtians there are few who are damned for not having exerciſed bodily mercy, none being obliged thereunto under mortal ſin, unleſs in the utmoſt and greateſt neceſſity of his neighbour, which happens very rarely, ſo as to impoſe any great obligation on any particular perſon.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tolet</hi> and others ſay, that there is no obligation to aſſiſt a neighbour but in ſome great and extream neceſſity; and
<hi>Leſſius</hi> adds, that this great and extream neceſſity cannot happen but very rarely; <hi>in extrema &amp; gravi neceſſitate quae rarius ita contingit.</hi> Whence it follows, that we are not obliged to do alms and other works of mercy, but in extream neceſſity, that is to ſay in effect, that we are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never obliged; ſince this neceſſity doth ſcarce ever happen. Beſides to ſay even in this caſe, that there is no great obligation upon us to aſſiſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and to ſay that there is none at all, is the very ſame thing; becauſe the matter being very great, in regard that the lives of men in great extremity are therein concerned, the obligation to aſſiſt them muſt needs be great, or none at all. Alſo it will appear leſs ſtrange to ſay, that we are not at all obliged to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the death of a man when we can conveniently, than to ſay that we are indeed obliged thereunto; but it is only a venial ſin to fail in this obligation, and to ſuffer him to dye.</p>
                  <p>So that theſe Jeſuits ſay in effect, that we are not abſolutely obliged to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour our neighbour, even in the extreameſt neceſſity, what convenience ſoever we have to do it; and being not obliged in ſuch neceſſity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21510"/> it follows thence by ſtronger reaſon, that we are not bound thereunto upon any other occaſion. And by conſequence the obligation to give alms is entirely aboliſhed in all ſorts of perſons, times, and occaſions.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Leſſius</hi> doth yet farther diſcover this pernicious Doctrine of his Company, adding that even then when this ſo extream and rare neceſſity doth happen, no perſon is particularly obliged to provide againſt it: for that the obligation to aſſiſt our neighbour in this eſtate of extream neceſſity being general and common to all thoſe who have means to do it, every one may put it off from himſelf unto others; in ſuch manner that we cannot ſay, that this man or that man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is obliged thereunto: <hi>quae rarius ita contingit ut hunc vel illum in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari graviter obliget.</hi> That is to ſay, that the Commandment to aſſiſt our neighbour in extream neceſſity is general to all thoſe who are of ability: but it doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily oblige none in particular. And ſo according to <hi>Leſſius</hi> Divinity a poor man being in entremity may dye of hunger in the view of many perſons who may and ought aſſiſt him, whilſt they expect and attend one another, no one of them <pb n="243" facs="tcp:46318:138"/>being particularly bound to ſatisfie an obligation which is common unto them all together.</p>

For he doth it only to ſtir up men, and particularly thoſe of the common ſort who are not capable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſpiritual things, to exerciſe theſe good works in this life. Now this reaſon cannot have place in the laſt Judgment, becauſe then there will be no need to ſtir up men unto works of mercy.</hi> He declares plainly, that the Goſpel is falſe, and ſpeaks falſe things to deceive the people and ignorant. For if it be lawful to have this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of what Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſaith concerning his laſt Judgment, and the circumſtances, and the words of that Judgment which he will pronounce concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens eternal life and death, it will by ſtronger reaſon be lawful to have the ſame thoughts of other places of the Goſpel which are not ſo important, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of all, ſince one cannot be more true than another. So we may clude the whole Word of God, when we meet therein any thing that doth not agree with our opinions, and we ſhall give occaſion particularly in this Subject to thoſe, who will conceive with <hi>Origen,</hi> that the pains of the damned ſhall not be eternal; to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt hath not ſaid that they ſhall be ſo, but only to divert men from ſin, and to cauſe them to fear by propoſing unto them infinite puniſhments, according as this Jeſuit ſaith, that he neither threatens nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns thoſe who fail to do works of mercy, but only to intimidate men, and particularly thoſe of the Commonalty, and to ſtir them up to employ themſelves therein, being incapable of other more elevated actions.</p>
                  <p>Being all good works are compriſed and contained in alms,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21540"/> faſting, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, according to the Scripture, it ſeems that having here treated particularly of alms, I ought alſo to ſpeak of faſting and of prayer, becauſe I have ſaid that the Jeſuits deſtroy and corrupt all good works in general.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I have ſpoken expreſly of Faſting in the explication of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Church, of Supplication in the Chapter of Prayer; and alſo in that of Eccleſiaſtick Duties, and the obligation which we have to ſay Divine Service, I will be content to ſend the Reader thither, to avoid tediouſneſs and repetitions. In reading thoſe places we may find that the Jeſuits are no leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to mens effeminacy than to their intereſts, and that they are as large and indulgent in freeing them from all the pains of faſting and prayer, as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting them from the obligation of giving their goods and doing alms; teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying by this ſo obſequious Doctrine, and ſo baſe and looſe a conduct, that all their ſtudy and care in a manner tends to the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom of Luſt, by favouring the corrupt paſſions and inclinations of men, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof to deſtroy true Chriſtian piety, both in its fountain which is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in its effects and fruits which are good Works.</p>

                           <hi>As for me I ſometimes thought that the divine Precept which commands us to receive Baptiſm or Penance urging us, and a Tyrant forbidding us to receive it upon pain of our lives, we ceaſe not to be obliged to receive it, that we may make our Salvation certain ſo far as in us lyes.</hi> So that if God on one hand command Baptiſm on the pain of loſing eternal life, and a Tyrant on the other hand forbid it on the pain of loſing temporal life, the Jeſuit permits us to obey the Tyrant rather than Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the very word of Jeſus Chriſt who ſaith in the Goſpel, that he who would ſave his Soul, that is, his life, ſhall loſe it; and contrary to that of S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> which being an explication of that of Jeſus Chriſt, is alſo more expreſs and more clear in our caſe; that we ought to obey God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than men even in peril of our lives; according as this Apoſtle did indeed expoſe his by preaching Jeſus Chriſt againſt the prohibition of the chief Jews.</p>

                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:46318:139"/>He grounds then the neceſſity and obligation to receive Baptiſm on the effect it worketh rather than on the Command which ordaineth it to be received: and becauſe that this effect which is to be delivered from ſin and damnation is not always entirely certain, ſo that we may in ſome ſort doubt thereof, even after we have received the Sacrament, the obligation to receive it according to him is alſo not entirely evident and aſſured, but uncertain; which ſuffices him to make the obligation of the divine Precept to receive Baptiſm queſtionable when a Tyrant forbids to receive it on pain of life; and to form two probable opinions both ſafe in conſcience, whence he follows and maintains that which diſpenſes in theſe incident caſes with the precept and obligation of Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>He ſaith the ſame thing of Penance, and by the ſame Principle and ſelf ſame Reaſon which he makes uſe of to aboliſh the obligation to theſe two Sacraments, it will be eaſie for him to ruine alſo when he pleaſes not only the precept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to other Sacraments, as that of Confirmation and the Communion; but alſo generally of all the Commands of God and the Church, or the obligation to obey them when a Tyrant ſhall forbid them on pain of life, there being no Command ſo important, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21580"/> nor whereof the effect is more aſſured than that of Baptiſm. So that if becauſe the effect of Baptiſm is not always ſo certain, that we cannot abſolutely doubt thereof at all, this Jeſuit pretends that the Precept of Baptiſm though divine, obliges us not at all when we are menaced with death if we receive it; it is clear that any other precept whatſoever it be ſhall never oblige us, ſo that we ſhall not have liberty to diſpenſe with it in this ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: and ſo the Doctrine of Probability, as we have already obſerved on divers occaſions, overturns and ruines in divers manners all the Commands of God and the Church.</p>

The Jeſuits may well deſpiſe this Word, and craze this Law out of their Writings and out of their Books, but it ſhall abide eternally in the Book of God which is the Goſpel, who ſhall condemn them at the day of Judgment who have taught as well as thoſe who have done contrary to what he ſaith.</p>

For if one ſhould ſay that he might withdraw himſelf from it through honour and reſpect, not eſteeming himſelf worthy of ſo great a gift and bounty of God, he would therein teſtifie at the leaſt ſome eſteem for this Sacrament of the Holy Ghoſt. But to maintain that one may withdraw from it of his own will only, and without any reaſon, and without troubling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about the Graces and Bleſſings which he might receive therefrom, is to teſtifie manifeſtly that we make no great account of it, and that we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to the rank of things indifferent.

                        <p>But becauſe this wicked Doctrine is entirely oppoſite to the conſent of the Holy Fathers and Councils who acknowledge the neceſſity of Confirmation, the Jeſuits have found out a new invention to defeat their Authority herein. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21650"/> They anſwer that the

For hitherto none ever ſpoke of a neceſſity of benefit, it being clear that what is only beneficial (as is Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with the Jeſuits) is not neceſſary: and that to joyn in this manner <hi>a neceſſity to utility or an utility to neceſſity,</hi> is to form a kind of Monſter compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of two contrary parts, whereof the one deſtroys the other.

                        <p>But to ſhew yet more clearly that this neceſſity of utility is but a vain word which they have invented to obſcure the light of the Ancient Doctrine of the Church, it is manifeſt that according to them it is impoſſible there ſhould be any true neceſſity of any kind for the Sacrament of Confirmation, ſince they hold that it is not commanded by any law of God or the Church, and that the Grace which it confers may be obtained not only by other Sacraments, but alſo by every ſort of good works and exerciſes of Religion, as appears by the Books of Engliſh Jeſuits condemned by the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and ſince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly owned by the Jeſuits in the Book of <hi>Alegambe</hi> approved by their General.

                        <p>There are two occaſions upon which the Sacrament of Confirmation ſeems to be moſt neceſſary, that of perſecution and peril of death, and that of receiving holy Orders. <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſpeaking of the firſt, ſaith:

<hi>being of great importance, if there were any Commandment for it, it would oblige under mortal ſin; and there being no ſuch obligation, as we have ſaid before, there is then no precept in this point:</hi> And conſequently it is no ſin at all not to receive this Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be obſerved here, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21680"/> that the Jeſuits have acknowledged at firſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for receiving Confirmation, and have contented themſelves to confine and reſtrain it to the firſt ages of the Church, in which perſecutions were frequent, pretending that it is expired in theſe our times. Afterwards they have ſaid that if this precept did yet oblige at preſent, it was not with ſo great rigour as that it ſhould be any great ſin to go againſt it; and that the Fathers and Councils that had ordained the Faithful to receive this Sacrament, had ordained it only by way of Counſel and not of Precept. 3. From thence they have inferred that it can be at moſt but a Venial ſin to omit Confirmation and neglect the Precept of receiving it. 4. They alſo at length wipe out even that Venial ſin, that they may entirely aboliſh the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment for this Sacrament, and perhaps the Sacrament if ſelf if they could, ſo much paſſion and injuſtice do they expreſs in fighting againſt it.</p>
                        <p>It is by this way and by theſe degrees that they have introduced many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, Errors, and looſe Principles, both into the manners and doctrine of the Church, which they maintain publickly at this day as Truths and Rules of Chriſtian Piety.</p>

But this it alſo a greater contempt of the order of the Church, of the Authority of an Oecumenick Council, and of all Eccleſiaſtick Tradition and Diſcipline, not to fear at leaſt to violate it by a voluntary withdrawing from, and neglect of theſe ſo formal words of the Council of <hi>Trent; Primâ Tonſurâ non initientur, qui Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum Confirmationis non ſuſceperint.</hi> As if theſe words did not contain an Ordinance, but only a counſel and ſimple propoſition. Which is a very eaſie way to overthrow all the Decrees of Councils and the Church, and to render them entirely unprofitable.</p>
                        <p>Here we muſt take notice of the ſpirit of theſe Divines, and the licence which they take to play with Sacraments and Conſciences. They debaſe Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as much as they can, and carry themſelves with viſible paſſion to the diminiſhing of the vertue of this Sacrament, which is the accompliſhment of Baptiſm, without which the grace of Baptiſm continues imperfect, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not ſuch but only imperfectly, according to the Fathers; and on the other hand we ſee them carry indifferently all the world to confeſſion and the Communion with ſo much ardour and importunity, that they make it the head point of their direction, as the greater part of thoſe who follow their conduct make it the principal part of their devotion.</p>
                        <p>Which thing is ſo much the more conſiderable, for that if we pre-ſuppoſe even with them that there is no command which obliges us to receive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21710"/> ſo alſo neither is there any that obliges us to confeſs ofther then once a year; and this precept of Confeſſion is not at all for Venial ſins, which notwithſtanding are the matter of the Confeſſions which they reiterate and cauſe to be reiterated ſo often by devout perſons and thoſe who defire to live Chriſtian-like; and nevertheleſs if they knew any one who ſhould divert Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents from their Tribunals, or who ſhould only ſay to them that it was not neceſſary for them to confeſs ſo often when they have only Venial ſins which may be blotted out by other ways, they would doubtleſs condemn him, and hold him more to blame, then if he had committed ſome great crime; and yet they make no ſcruple to turn away all the faithful indifferently from Confirmation, by this reaſon only, although a falſe one, that there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation nor neceſſity on them to receive it.</p>
                        <p>But if any will ſay, that the cuſtom of confeſſing and communicating fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is received in the Church, and thoſe who make a ſpecial Profeſſion of Piety ought to follow it, and cannot neglect it without teſtifying that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn it with pride; we muſt confeſs by this reaſon that we are much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation, and we cannot neglect the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities thereof without diſcovering greater pride and contempt againſt this Sacrament, ſince it is manifeſt that the order, cuſtom, and uſe of receiving it, is much more ancient, more authorized, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21720"/> and more generally and religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Church, than that of frequent Confeſſion of venial ſins, this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice becoming common only of late times; and that of Confirmation having been generally received and holily obſerved from the beginning of the Church and in all latter Ages, ſo that there hath never been found any one Saint, pious Perſon, or Chriſtian living Chriſtian-like who hath dared to reject it, or who hath withdrawn himſelf voluntarily from it until our times, wherein the Jeſuits have begun to introduce this new Doctrine and new Practice of Devotion.</p>
                        <p>But it is eaſie to ſee by the Spirit and ordinary Carriage of the Jeſuits, that that which carries them on to aggravate with ſo great care the obligation and neceſſity of Confeſſion and of the Communion, and on the contrary to diminiſh that of Confirmation; to puſh on Chriſtians indifferently to theſe two firſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and to keep them at diſtance from the laſt, is thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>ARTICLE II. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21730"/> Of the Euchariſt and Penance. <hi>What ſort of Diſpoſitions the Jeſuits demand for theſe two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that they teach men to prophane them by Sacriledge.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS the Jeſuits incline all ſorts of perſons indifferently to confeſs and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, it behoves them that they may bring them on thereunto to make the practice and uſe of theſe two Sacraments very eaſie. We have already ſeen in the Chapter of Penance that they have ſo ſweetned the yoke of Confeſſion, that to confeſs well there needs in a manner nothing but to know how to ſpeak and declare ones ſins, though in many caſes they give liberty alſo to conceal one part, and though one do accuſe himſelf in general, without ſpecifying any in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they oblige him not abſolutely to repeat his Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>And as for their Penitents who confeſs frequently, they permit them almoſt any thing, even to deceive them and lye in Confeſſion, without believing they commit any great fault, provided it be only in a matter of venial ſin: that if they have committed mortal ſins which they are aſhamed to diſcover, they may by the advice of theſe directors confeſs them to other Prieſts to preſerve their reputation with their ordinary Confeſſor. They will alſo make their Penance as eaſie as their Confeſſion if they pleaſe. For if they be not in a humour to perform it, that they may give them neither trouble nor ſcruple, they will impoſe it on them only by way of counſel, or without preſcribing them any thing in particular, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21740"/> they are content to ſay unto them;
<hi>Impono tibi pro poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia quiequid hodie vel hac hebdomada boni feceris, vel mali paſſus fueris. I impoſe upon you for Penance whatſoever good you ſhall do, or evil you ſhall ſuffer this day or this week.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a perſon over-run with crimes addreſs himſelf to them, and be troubled to make known the bottom of his Conſcience and to diſcover the corruption of his Heart, by declaring his wicked inclinations and habits, they will not preſs on him in this point, no more then to tell them in particular the number of his wicked deſires, impurities, and ſecret crimes which move in his ſpirit and in his heart, though it were eaſie for him to do it if he would; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves if he ſay, <hi>Amavi Mariam toto menſe, toto anno. I have loved</hi> Mary <hi>a whole month, a whole year.</hi> But if he alſo ſtartle at Penance, they will give him ſo ſlight an one that he cannot refuſe it; they will even leave him to his choice, if it be needful, and they will remit him to do his Penance in the other world.</p>
                     <p>After this they muſt wholly renounce all devotion, who will not go to confeſs themſelves to the Jeſuits; and it ſeems that he who refuſes can have no other pretence then to ſay that he hath no devotion; and he may adde that he cannot have any for Confeſſion as the Jeſuits repreſent it, and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that he confeſſes himſelf as he ought, if he confeſs as they ſay he may.</p>
                     <p>But after all this, though one will not be devout, if he be a Catholick he muſt at leaſt confeſs himſelf at <hi>Eaſter,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21750"/> that thereupon he may communicate: the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Church is expreſs, and to fail herein were to decry and declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a man of no Religion. The Jeſuits have therefore provided for this alſo; they have made the obſervation of this Precept ſo eaſie, that the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched and moſt impious may diſcharge this duty according to them, without being obliged not only to change their lives, but to interrupt the courſe of their debauches for the time only while they go to Church, and return after they have preſented themſelves to a Prieſt to whom they may tell only what they pleaſe of their ſins, and do alſo what they liſt of all that he ſaith to them. For it is a common opinion amongſt theſe Doctors, that we may ſatisfie the Command <pb n="252" facs="tcp:46318:143"/>which ordains that we ſhould at leaſt confeſs our ſelves once a year by any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Confeſſion whatſoever it be, provided that we can ſay that it is a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though it be a Sacriledge.</p>
                     <p>They ſay the ſame thing of the Communion, and hold that we may ſatisfie the Command of the Church in communicating unworthily and receiving the Body of Jeſus Chriſt after we have confeſſed in the manner now related, or without any Confeſſion at all, though we believe we are in mortal ſin, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with crimes. But becauſe I ſhall handle theſe two Points in their proper place, expounding the Commandments of the Church according to the Maxims of the Jeſuits, I will not ſpeak thereof here at all, and I will reſt ſatisfied only in repreſenting ſome of the diſpoſitions with which they hold, that we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate worthily and receive the fruit of the Communion. They grant indeed that our conſcience muſt not be charged with any crime, but they hardly require any thing farther.</p>
                     <p>It is from this Principle that <hi>Filliutius</hi> ſpeaking of diſpoſitions for this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaith at firſt, that we ought to be in a ſtate of Grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21760"/> and free from mortal ſin, but in the ſequel he declares that there needs no other preparation.

                        <hi>As to actual ſin,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which is committed in the very Communion it ſelf, it hinders not at all from receiving the Grace of the Communion, becauſe this ſin makes not the perſon unworthy of</hi> the participation of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe, according to him, there is nothing but mortal ſin that is capable of cauſing this unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.</p>
                     <p>He may ſay by the ſame reaſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21770"/> that he who ſhould be ſo rude as of meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to joſtle the King, and loſe all the reſpect he owes him, whilſt he fits with him at his Table, ſhould not thereby render himſelf by this inſolence unworthy of the honour which he had done him; or that a Child who was reſolved to do his Father all the diſpleaſure he could, and ſhould actually do it, Parricide only excepted, ſhould not be ſo unworthy but that he might receive him to his Table, and give him the utmoſt teſtimonies of paternal affection. For this is in effect that which he maintains when he declares that there is nothing but mortal ſin which renders a man indiſpoſed for the Communion; and that no venial ſin, though voluntary, nor even that which is purpoſely committed whilſt the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is actually received, can render him who commits it unworthy of the Communion nor of the fruit of the Grace which it confers; he thinks alſo that be hath found a good reaſon to ſupport his opinion, when he ſaith,

                        </note>
                        <hi>That otherwiſe he who communicates in this diſpoſition ſins mortally, becauſe he who receives unworthily the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, eats and drinks his own damnation.</hi> As if we could not communicate unworthily without ſinning mortally. This is on one ſide too rigorous to think that all indiſpoſitions in the Communion ſhould be mortal; and on the other ſide too large to believe that all ſorts of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſins, even voluntary and affected, ſhould not be indiſpoſitions to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21780"/> All that which renders the ſtomach incapable of receiving food or of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting it, is not mortal; and yet though the food received in this eſtate kills not the perſon, yet it ceaſes not to weaken him, and to cauſe in him thoſe diſeaſes which ſometimes bring him to his end.</p>
                     <p>But foreſeeing that it might be juſtly objected unto him, that his opinion is <pb n="253" facs="tcp:46318:143"/>univerſally condemned by the Holy Fathers and Councils, there where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the great purity wherewith the Body of Jeſus Chriſt ought to be received in the Communion; he ſaith to prevent this objection:
<note n="1" place="margin">Qued ſi Sancti Patres vineaiſtur plus exigere, incelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendi ſunt vel in ordine ad u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliorem &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis fructuoſam ſumptionem, vel quoad c n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilium. <hi>Ibid. num.</hi>
165.</note> 
                        <hi>That if the Holy Fathers ſeem to demand more, we muſt take that which they ſay as a counſel, or as an exhortation to communicate with more fruit and benefit.</hi> There is nothing more eaſie than in this manner to defeat all Authorities and all the Ordinances of the Fathers and Councils. There is nothing ſo formal in the Scripture it ſelf which may not be cluded by this diſtinction, making every thing paſs for counſel which appears contrary to our ſenſe, and too rigorous to the fleſh, that ſo we may diſpenſe therewith without ſcruple.</p>
                     <p>He relates amongſt others the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> daring even to pretend that it is for him in this Point:
<note n="2" place="margin">Quia ex Scriptura &amp; Conſiliis tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum colligitur debere eum qui communicat ſe probare. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we can collect no other thing from Scripture and from Councils than that he who communicates ought to try himſelf. Now the Council of</hi> Trent, ſeſſ. 13.
<hi>teacheth us that this proof conſiſts in this, that no perſon who believes himſelf guilty of mortal ſin, ought to approach unto the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt without being confeſſed firſt of all.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21790"/> It is indeed true that the Council demands this. It ordaineth that they who perceive themſelves guilty of any crime ſhould purifie themſelves from it by the Sacrament of Penance, before they approach to the Communion; but it declares beyond this, that every man penitent or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ought to be informed of the dignity and holineſs of this heavenly Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to take heed
<note n="3" place="margin">Ne abſque magna reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; ſanctitate ad percipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum accedat. <hi>Conc. Trid. ſeſſ.</hi> 13.

                     </p>
                     <p>This is not to be in great holineſs, but ſimply without great evil, to be exempt only from mortal ſin; and none can ſay that this is to have a profound reverence for Jeſus Chriſt, to offend him voluntarily in receiving. And yet though the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil forbids to communicate without very great holineſs and profound reverence, <hi>Filliutius</hi> ceaſes not to pretend that we may communicate worthily in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting venial ſins whilſt we do communicate, and perſiſting in them voluntarily.</p>
                     <p>And to remove all ſcruple from them who are fallen into crimes, and yet have a defire to communicate, he puts this queſtion:

                        <hi>That he who hath remorſe for his ſins, and who hath confeſſed them, may abſolutely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, though the very night before, or even a little before the Communion he have ſinned mortally.</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21800"/> He demands no other interval between the crime and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than that which is neceſſary unto Confeſſion, into whatſoever diſorders and abominations we be plunged before, pretending that we may paſs in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the moſt enormous ſins to the Altar and participation of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: that is to ſay, from Hell into Paradiſe, and from the eſtate of a Devil to that of an Angel, ſince he that eats the bread of Angels ought to participate of the eſtate and purity of Angels.</p>
                     <p>He muſt be both a bad Divine that holds Maxims ſo oppoſite to the judgment and perpetual diſcipline of the Church, and a bad Philoſopher who imagines that the ſpirit of a man can ſo eaſily paſs in an inſtant from the moſt violent deordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of paſſions, to the peace and purity of contrary vertues; and he muſt alſo be a far worſe Chriſtian to be ſo little touched with reſpect and love to Jeſus Chriſt and his neighbour, as to expoſe the one ſo raſhly to ſo great contempt and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy uſage, and the other to ſo viſible a ruine and damnation. And if he be not abſolutely impious and a Libertine who holds an opinion ſo horrible, he muſt be at the leaſt more bold and impudent than the impious and Libertines themſelves, who without doubt, dare not maintain publickly what this Jeſuit maintains, and have not the confidence at any time to talk thus before conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons who have any ſenſe of piety, but that they know theſe diſcourſes are found amongſt the Books of the Jeſuits.</p>

                        <hi>That the common opinion of the Doctors is that the Confeſſor ought to give this counſel.</hi> But he declares at the ſame time that it is not his, and that
<hi>the opinion of</hi> Sancius <hi>pleaſes him better, to wit, that this counſel ought not to be given theſe perſons; but rather to incline them to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, provided they be well diſpoſed thereunto by Confeſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he would not only that a Confeſſor ſhould not divert them from the Communion; but he pretends alſo,
<note n="4" place="margin">Deinde etiam conſulendum ne poenitentes defraudentur gratiâ hujus Sacramenti &amp; aliis plurimis effectibus, Ideo reus erit qui dignum poenitentem communione defraudar, &amp; ille talis dignus eſt.</note> 
                        <hi>That he is obliged to incline them to it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21820"/> that he may not deprive the Penitent of the Grace of this Sacrament and many other effects.</hi> And this obligation, according to him, is ſo ſtrict, that <hi>the Confeſſor makes himſelf guilty,</hi> reus erit, <hi>if he deprive a Penitent of the Communion who is worthy of it, as he is of whom the queſtion proceeds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Confeſſor is guilty for not inclining unto the Communion thoſe who are fallen the ſame day into voluntary and mortal pollution, S. <hi>Paul</hi> will be much more ſo in the judgment of this Divine when he counſels married perſons to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the uſe of Marriage, which though lawful, renders married perſons indiſpoſed unto prayer; which will be falſe: And by conſequence the counſel which he gives them upon this Principle, to live in continence that they may pray, will be ill founded and raſh, if the crimes of Luxury hinder not thoſe who have committed them, from going the ſame day to the Communion, and gives not power unto a Confeſſor to counſel them to abſtain from it, it being manifeſt that the Communion requires a greater purity and preparation than prayer.</p>
                     <p>The Church alſo muſt have been many Ages in errour, when it did not only counſel, but alſo command by many expreſs Canons, that thoſe who were fallen into mortal ſins of impurity and others, ſhould be deprived many years of the Communion, what remorſe ſoever they teſtified for their crimes.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this Jeſuit is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21830"/> that wrong would be done unto this ſinner by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving him of the grace and fruits of the Sacrament: <hi>Ne defraudetur gratia hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus Sacramenti &amp; aliis plurimis effectibus.</hi> He ſuppoſes that he is truly converted in a moment, being one ſtep out of his debauches, and that he is entred all at once, without doing any thing elſe but confeſſing himſelf, into the diſpoſitions neceſſary for receiving the grace and effects of the Communion: which is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding at the leaſt very doubtful, there being cauſe to fear rather that the Communion might turn to his condemnation, than to preſume that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fruits and bleſſings which it communicates unto thoſe who receive it worthily.</p>
                     <p>This conſideration for all that and this fear touches not nor aſtoniſhes this Jeſuit. For though it were manifeſt that this ſinner were not re-entred into the Grace of God by Confeſſion, and that he ſhould commit Sacriledge by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in an eſtate of mortal ſin; he pretends that however, though he received <pb n="255" facs="tcp:46318:144"/>not at the preſent the grace and other effects of the Communion, he yet ſhould not for all that wholly loſe them; but they ſhould be held in reſerve and kept for him until ſuch time as he ſhould receive more purely. This is that he teſtifies when he ſaith:

                     <p>According to theſe Maxims and this reaſoning of our Jeſuit, a man who doubts whether he owe a ſum of money or a rent, or who being aſſured that he owes it, doubts whether he have paid it, or who knows certainly that he doth owe it and hath not paid it, and doubts only whether he to whom he owes it hath gotten it well, or whether there were not ſome defect in the contract, in all theſe caſes and in all theſe doubts, ſhall not be obliged to pay.</p>

This is a good Maxime to husband Maſſes ſo well that you may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Ioſe any one at all, and to engage mercenary Prieſts to ſay Maſſes every day without fear of loſing their labour, by having ſome always laid up in readineſs for thoſe who ſhall firſt preſent themſelves unto them.

                     <p>As the Jeſuits do thus teach Prieſts to ſay Maſs out of covetouſneſs; ſo they do not much condemn thoſe who ſay it of vain glory. <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> tells us,

It is properly to ſacrifice unto vanity, and to refer the Sacrifice of the Maſs to the Devil as to his chief end. For we ſacrifice not unto God but by offering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the ſame Sacrifice unto him in the ſame manner. A ſtrange kind of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and unheard of amongſt the Heathens! For this is not to ſacrifice one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto another, as they did: but it is to ſacrifice unto a creature and even to a vice God himſelf and the Son of God, by offering and referring thereto Jeſus Chriſt as to the principal end.

                  <p>THE Phyſitian labours for his Patient when he preſcribes what he ought to do, as well as when he preſents unto him what he ought to take for his Cure. Whence it comes that they ſay commonly that he hath given him a good Remedy, when he hath given him good advice how to remove the Diſeaſe whereof he is ſick. So that not only the things which he preſcribes, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions themſelves are remedies; but with this difference, that what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, as Purges and Medicines, are the inward remedies, becauſe they act upon the diſeaſe it ſelf, and have an internal vertue proper to deſtroy it when they are taken effectually: but the preſcriptions are as it were external remedies, becauſe they act not immediately upon the diſeaſe, but only upon the mind of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſed by the knowledge they give him of his diſeaſe, and of what he ought to do for his cure.</p>
                  <p>We muſt ſay the ſame thing, holding the Rules of Proportion, of our Souls diſeaſes and remedies. We have already obſerved that Grace, Penance, good Works, and the Sacraments are the internal remedies of ſin, becauſe they have a divine and internal vertue which the Spirit of God hath impreſſed upon them to expel ſin from the Soul, or to prevent its entrance thereinto. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22120"/> And we ſay here that the holy Scripture, the Commandments of God, and thoſe of the Church are the external remedies of the ſame ſin; becauſe though they act not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon ſin, they act upon the mind of the ſinner; and if they change not his will internally, they touch his mind and conſcience externally by the knowledge they give him of ſin, and by the fear which they impreſs upon him of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments with which God hath threatned thoſe who commit them.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen in the former Part of this ſecond Book, that the Jeſuits deſtroy the internal remedies of ſin; we ſhall ſee here in this, how they aboliſh or corrupt the external: and ſo it will appear that they favour and cheriſh ſin as much as <pb n="267" facs="tcp:46318:150"/>they can.

                  <head>CHAPTER I. <hi>Of the Corruption of Scripture. That the Jeſuits corrupt the Scriptures divers ways.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere are only three things to be conſidered in the holy Scripture; the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Senſe, and the Authority. And accordingly we may diſtinguiſh three different manners of corrupting holy Scripture. 1. In the Letter, by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22130"/> taking away, or changing ſomething in the ſacred Text. 2. In the Senſe, by falſe Expoſitions. 3. In the Authority, by debaſing the Author, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the belief that is due unto him. Now let us ſee in what manner the Jeſuits have corrupted and yet do every day corrupt the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>We might compoſe great Volumes of Paſſages which they have altered by falſe Interpretations, yea, may be of all places wherein Canonical Writers and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf have ſpoken with any vehemence and vigour concerning the Holineſs of our Myſteries, the Duties of a Chriſtian, and the narrow way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we ſhould be troubled to find one whereunto they have not given ſome blow, haling them from their natural ſenſe by Expoſitions falſe and contrary to the general Conſent of the Fathers and Tradition of the Church, that they might accommodate them to the reliſh and luſts of worldly men. I will relate only ſome few to ſerve for Example.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, writing to the <hi>Corinthians:
<note n="1" place="margin">Si habut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro omnem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, Ita ut montes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feram, charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem autem non habuero, nihil ſum. Et ſi di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribuero in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos pauperum omnes faculta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes meas; &amp; ſi tradidero cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum ita ut ardesm, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem autem non habuero, nihil mihi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. 1 <hi>Cor. cap.</hi> 15.</note> Though I had faith to remove mountains, and had not charity, I were nothing. And though I ſhould diſtribute all my goods to the relief of the poor, and though I ſhould give my body to be burnt, if I had not charity, it would avail me nothing.</hi> But Father <hi>Celot</hi> being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to maintain the contrary, ſaying that we may ſuffer Martyrdom profitably, and do thoſe other works whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks like a Chriſtian, without any motion from Charity: to defend himſelf from this paſſage ſo ſtrong and ſo manifeſt, he corrupts and ſubverts it in this manner.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith that this muſt be extended to the habit,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22140"/> and not to the act and motion of Charity, meaning that the actions of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, may be meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, holy, and perfect, though they be done without love to God, and though we never think of him, provided we be in an eſtate of Grace. So that he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that a man who is in the eſtate of Grace, cannot act otherwiſe than by this Charity whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks. See his words:
<note n="2" place="margin">Eo loco habitum chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis poſtulari ab Apoſtolo aio ego 3 negat Petrus Aurelius, &amp; actum vult intelligi.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſay that the Apoſtle in this place demands only the habit of Charity,</hi> Petrus Aurelius <hi>on the contrary holds that it ought to be extended unto the act.</hi> And a little after:
<note n="3" place="margin">Actum profecto laudant, ſuadent, &amp; omnibus praeſerunt Scripturae; at habitum charitatis tanquam rem ſemper neceſſariam expetunt. <hi>Celot. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.
<hi>pag.</hi> 125.</note> 
                     <hi>It is true that the Scripture commends the act of Charity, that it directs and adviſes us to it, and prefers it before all other things; but it commands the habit as being continually neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak in this place only of the habit of Charity, he requires it in vain of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſeeing they had it, as he himſelf ſuppoſes, calling them juſt and holy; it is in vain that he exhorts, that he advertiſes them, that when they ſuffer any perſecution, when they give alms, when they perform any other good work, they ſhould do it of Charity, ſince they, having the habit of Charity, could not act otherwiſe than by Charity, this habit having neceſſary influence upon all their actions, as <hi>Celot</hi> pretends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coninck</hi> ſpeaks alſo more clearly to this Point. For he ſaith that to be a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22150"/> it is not neceſſary to have an actual will, nor ſo much as a virtual one; but that it ſufficeth to have an interpretative and habitual one according to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Schools. And he explains this term of an interpretative and virtual <pb n="268" facs="tcp:46318:151"/>one by theſe Examples:
<note n="1" place="margin">Qualis eſt in eo primo qui fugiens tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num à quo compellitur ad impia, in fuga ſubito occidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Secundo in eo qui ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatur ad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem fidei, quia banc recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavit, dormiens occiditur. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninck</hi> 3. <hi>p. q.</hi> 66.

                     <hi>Such an one as that of a perſon flying from a Tyrant who would force him to ſome impiety, is ſlain unexpectedly in his flight: or at leaſt of him who being ſollicited to renounce the faith, is killed in his ſleep, becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe it may be ſaid that theſe perſons had a will to maintain the faith, and to dye for it, ſince the one fled for fear to loſe it, and the other refuſed to renounce it, and ſo they are faithful in their will to dye for the faith; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that neither is this at all neceſſary, and that

                     </note> 
                     <hi>it ſufficeth that they be killed out of hatred to the faith, though they had not formerly ſo much as a thought of confeſſing it, as it happens when in ſudden Eruptions of</hi> Barbarians <hi>one is killed in his ſleep through hatred of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that he believes that one may be a Martyr, and merit the reward of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, not only without any act of Charity, but alſo without any act of Faith, and without ſo much as any natural and reaſonable act, dying without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and without any thought had before-hand of dying for the Faith.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it may be imagined that he grounds himſelf on the preparation of the heart of this man, believing that God regards the good diſpoſition which he had unto Martyrdom. But neither doth he demand ſo much as that. And he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth on the contrary, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22160"/> that if it had been put to his choice either to dye or renounce God and Jeſus Chriſt, he would rather have been ready and in more danger to abandon the Faith.

                     <hi>It matters not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>though if death had been propoſed unto this man, the fear it would have brought on him would poſſibly have forced him to forget God, becauſe this conditional ſuppoſition produces no real thing in this man; and ſo it cannot hurt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He believes then, that to be a Martyr it is not at all neceſſary to have ſo much as a conditional will to dye for God, if occaſions were preſented, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſition rather to forſake God than to loſe his life on this occaſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt him; and by conſequence that it is not bad, nor hinders a man from being in an eſtate to receive the Crown of Martyrdom if he dye without ever thinking of it in this diſpoſition by the hand of a Tyrant.</p>
                  <p>But he diſcovers the ground of this Doctrine when he ſaith,

                  <p>This ſame Jeſuit hath corrupted another paſſage of the

                     <hi>For Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Council, <hi>communicating vigour continually to thoſe who are juſtified, as the head communicates unto its members, and the Vine unto its branches, and this vigour preceding, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying, and following always their good works, which without it could not in any ſort whatſoever be pleaſing unto God and meritorious, we muſt believe that there is now nothing more wanting unto perſons juſtified which might hinder us from judging rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably that the works which are thus wrought in God, have ſatisfied his Law ſo far as the condition of this preſent life may permit, and that they have merited eternal life, which they ſhall in due time receive, provided they dye in this eſtate of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22190"/> It is clear that this vertue and this vigour which the Council ſaith that Jeſus Chriſt communicates inceſſantly to thoſe who do good works, is not an habitual vertue, or a ſimple habitude, as this Jeſuit pretends; but that it is actual, and it is a motion by which he applies unto them, and cauſes them to act. For it is actual Grace, as is manifeſt by the expreſſion of the Council, ſaying that it prevents, accompanies, and follows all good works; which is properly the deſcription of actual Grace according to the Scripture, the Judgment of the Fathers, and even of the School-Divines themſelves; and appertains not to a habit which prevents not good works, but leaves the will in an indifference to the production of them, and it muſt be the will which prevents and applies this habit, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that without this the other cannot move of it ſelf, and abides always without acting. And ſo the Council agrees very well with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the one ſaying that our good works ſhould be done in Charity; and the other, that they ought to be wrought in God, that is to ſay, in the Spirit and by the Spirit of God, who is no other than the Spirit of Love and Charity, and the words of the one expound the words of the other. But I ſee no means to reconcile them to this Jeſuit, for he can no longer pretend that the Council and S. <hi>Paul require only habitual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with an exemption only from all mortal ſin.</hi> The terms of the Council by which it expounds it ſelf, may alſo ſerve for expoſition unto S. <hi>Paul,</hi> being ſo clear, that it is impoſſible to obſcure them.</p>
                  <p>He corrupts alſo a third paſſage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22200"/> which is in the ſecond to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks in theſe words:
<note n="2" place="margin">Id enim quod in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti eſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaneum &amp; leve tribulatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis noſtrae, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pro modum in ſublimitate ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum gloriae pondus opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in nobis. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4.17.</note> 
                     <hi>For the tribulations which we endure in this life being momentary and light, produce in us a far more incomparable, full, ſolid, and eternal glory.</hi> And Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> pretends that he calls the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and afflictions of this life light, <hi>becauſe they have not in them the weight of the love of God to command them.</hi> That is, that they are light then when they are undergone without love: by conſequent weighty and burthenſom when they are born for love to God. Theſe words of S.
<hi>Paul</hi> were never thus expounded in the Church; and it is to fight with common ſenſe to ſay, that love is a weight and load which makes things heavy and burthenſom which are done upon the motion thereof.</p>
                  <p>All the Saints and Interpreters who have ſpoken of this paſſage, have conceived that S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls theſe preſent afflictions light; becauſe that the grief they cauſe <pb n="270" facs="tcp:46318:152"/>is light in compariſon of the Joys which they merit, as he ſaith that they endure but a moment in compariſon of the Eternity of Glory which is the recompence thereof. But that they ſhould be called light, when they are born without love, as if love did hinder them from being ſo, is that which never entred into the thought of any Interpreter ancient or novel. And if it were ſo, the afflictions of S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not be light, or we muſt ſay that he ſuffered them without love: The afflictions of the greateſt Saints alſo could not be light, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22210"/> but rather they muſt have been more weighty and burdenſom, when they have been entertained and ſupported with moſt Charity; and on the contrary theirs who ſuffered without love or without thoughts of God, and againſt their wills, ſhould be light and eaſie, which doth equally contradict Faith and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>It is needleſs to loſe time in refuting theſe Paradoxes and Extravagancies. There is no Divine nor prudent man that ſees not even by natural reaſon and experience, that on the contrary it is love and the motions of the affection which renders things light, eaſie, and even ſweet and pleaſant, though they be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves troubleſom and difficult. Which is yet more true of the love of God than of that of the Creatures, that being infinitely exalted above this in vertue and force, as well as in dignity.</p>
                  <p>This Jeſuit contents not himſelf to abuſe the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this manner; but he aſpires unto the fountain, and attempts to corrupt it alſo as well as the ſtreams. The firſt of the Commandments which God gave in the old Law, and which he hath repeated in the new, is:
<note n="1" place="margin">Diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex to to corde tuo.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</hi> And Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> is not afraid to maintain that we are not obliged by this Commandment to love God. <hi>For God,</hi> ſaith he, tr.
2. p. 16. <hi>commanding us to love him, is ſatisfied in the main that we obey him in his other Commandments.</hi> And as he ſaith alſo, pag. 28. A
<hi>God ſo loving and lovely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding us to love him, is ſatisfied that we obey him without loving him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is eaſie to deſtroy all the Commandments by this Method; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22220"/> there being none more important, nor more clearly explained, nor oftner repeated in the Old or New Teſtament than this. When God ſaith: <hi>Thou ſhalt love me with all thy heart,</hi> if it be lawful to ſay that he intends ſomething elſe than what he ſaith, and that he would not oblige us to love him, though he ſaith it with an expreſſion ſo clear and ſtrong, there can be nothing certain in the whole Word of God, and we may in this manner clude all the Commandments, pretending that he deſires not that of us which he demands, or that he would not oblige us in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to that which he teſtifies to be his deſire.</p>
                  <p>But the reaſon of this Father, why God would not have us to love him, is excellent, <hi>becauſe he is loving and lovely,</hi> as if love deſired any thing ſo much as reciprocal love, or could be otherwiſe acknowledged and ſatisfied than by this love. He ought alſo at leaſt to conſider that God is not only <hi>amiable and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> but alſo a great lover of truth and ſincerity: and that ſo there can be no apparent ground to make him a lyar or diſſembler, in commanding men to love him without deſiring to oblige them thereunto.</p>
                  <p>This Jeſuit corrupts alſo this ſame paſſage and Commandment in another manner, ſaying: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> ſignifies no other thing, than; thou ſhalt love him if thou wilt without being obliged thereto: <hi>becauſe the Commandment to love God is a Command of pleaſure in reſpect of affective love; but a Command of rigour in reſpect of effective love and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> p. 21. He would ſay that God by this Commandment demands the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, and not the affection; that he commands us to produce the effects of love without obliging us to have this love, and that he is content,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22230"/> provided we do the things which he commands, though they be done without loving him or thinking of him. No wiſe man would be ſerved in this manner of his children or of his friends, nor of his ſlaves themſelves, and who would not ſcorn ſuch ſervices?</p>
                  <p>He hath alſo invented a third gloſs, which is no other than a conſequence of the former, ſaying: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> ſignifies, thou ſhalt love him freely and without any obligation. <hi>For God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46318:152"/>God of love will be loved freely and without any obligation; and if he threaten, it is that he may be obeyed.</hi> But if we love not them freely whom we love of duty and upon obligation, we muſt ſay that a Son loves not his Father freely, becauſe he is obliged to love him by the Law of God and Nature: and if that which is done of duty be not freely done, it follows that the Religious Orders keep not their vows freely, nor the Faithful any of the Commandments of God, becauſe they are thereunto obliged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if he threatens,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is that he may be obeyed,</hi> and not that he may be beloved. We muſt believe then that there are no penalties nor threats againſt them that never love God. Which neither agrees with what S. <hi>Paui</hi> ſaith: <hi>He that loves not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be accurſed,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. nor with that which S. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22240"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> ſaith: <hi>Qui non diligit manet in morte,</hi> 1 John 3. <hi>He that loveth not abideth in death.</hi> The one threatning them with death, and the other with a curſe who love not Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There remains yet his laſt corruption of this very word of God of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</hi> That is to ſay, thou ſhalt not hate him at all. <hi>For albeit his ſacred love be not kindled in our hearts,</hi> ſaith he:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 19.</note> though we love him not at all, and the motive of Charity do not incline us to do that which he commands us, <hi>yet we ceaſe not for all that to obey the Commandment of Love, in as much as we do the works of Love. So that herein we may ſee the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; he hath not ſo much commanded us to love him, as not to hate him; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formally by an actual hate, which were indeed devilliſh; or materially by the tranſgreſſion of his Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This exceſs is viſible enough of it ſelf, and needs not be repreſented more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and it might eaſily be apprehended to be the extreameſt that can be committed on this ſubject, if there were not found another yet greater in this little Book, which is as it were the foundation of all the reſt. For he talks of the love of God as a thing odious and ſervile; and he repreſents the Commandment of loving God, as a yoke and ſervitude unſupportable, attributing it to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour and grace of Jeſus Chriſt that he hath delivered us, as he pretends, from the obligation of ſerving God in love, that our ſervices might be pleaſing to him, and meritorious unto eternal life. And to juſtifie this his imagination, which ſcents ſtrong of impiety, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22250"/> he abuſes theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt:
<note n="1" place="margin">Si vos Filius liberave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vere liberi critis. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>v</hi> 36.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Son make you free, you ſhall be free indeed:</hi> which ſpeak manifeſtly of freedom from ſin, as appears by what goes before. See here how he expounds this paſſage. <hi>If the Son make you free,</hi> ſaith he himſelf in S.
<hi>John, you ſhall be free indeed. Yea, I hope, we ſhall by his own proper teſtimony, yea even from that very ſtrait obligation wherewith ſome would charge us, which is to love God in every point which hath any reference unto merit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tr.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 60.</note> He pretends then that Jeſus Chriſt hath not only delivered us from ſin, as is formerly affirmed in this place; <hi>but alſo from the obligation even of loving God himſelf,</hi> and of ſerving him in love, <hi>which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears unto him too rigorous.</hi> Which hath reference to what he ſaith, tr. 2. p.
24. that God neither could nor ought command us to love him, but only to ſerve him. <hi>See here,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how God hath right and might command us his ſacred love, he hath right to command us ſo far as concerns the effect, but not in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the inward affection.</hi> It muſt needs be therefore that according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this man the love of God, or the Commandment to love God is ſome evil or unreaſonable thing, if he could not command us it, ſince it is certain that God may command every thing that is not evil, unjuſt, and unreaſonable.</p>
                  <p>To ſo many remarkable corruptions of divers paſſages of Scripture, he adds alſo one to juſtifie the reſt. For amongſt many objections which he propounds, and makes to himſelf, drawn for the moſt part out of the Scripture which in joyns us to do all things for the love of God, if we expect any recompence from him for them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22260"/> he relates this taken out of S. <hi>Matth. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 41.
<hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a Prophet in the quality of a Prophet, and a righteous man in the quality of a righteous man, ſhall receive therefore the reward due unto a Prophet and to a righteous man. Alſo he that giveth a glaſs of cold water to the meaneſt Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall not loſe his reward, provided he give it to him as a Diſciple of Jeſus
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46318:153"/>Chriſt.</hi> That is to ſay, for reſpect unto Jeſus Chriſt, and for his love, as theſe words do ſignifie ſufficiently of themſelves, and as the Holy Fathers and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters dounderſtand it.</p>
                  <p>See here his objection which he reſolves magiſterially, and by an interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it were for inſtruction rather than anſwer.
<hi>I agree it,</hi> ſaith he, tr. 3. pag. 71. &amp; 72. <hi>But what is it, think you, to treat a Prophet, a righteous man, and a Diſciple of the Son of God, as a Prophet, a righteous man, and a Diſciple of the Son of God? It is to honour him, invite him, do him good, and give him entertainment, whether it be to receive ſome inſtruction from him, or to imitate his good example, or to learn his Oracles, or for other good conſiderations,</hi> of which yet not one is ſo heightned as to reach the purity of the love of God.</p>
                  <p>He afterward makes this his opinion and anſwer more clear by an example and by a compariſon. <hi>I would gladly know of theſe Interpreters,</hi> (ſaith he, he ſpeaks of thoſe who ſay that to receive a Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple, is to receive him for love of Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>whether a man who is proſecuted by his Creditor, and who ſeeing one of his Agents coming to demand payment of the debt, goes to meet him, invites him, makes much of him, that he might win him over to him, and obtain ſome forbearance; I would gladly know whether this Debtor receive this Sollicitor as coming to him on the behalf of his Creditor, and whether the good entertainment he makes for him comes from a good heart and pure love which he hath for him who ſent him,</hi> pag. 73.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22270"/> Without doubt he hath reaſon to ſay that a poor man who ſeeth a Sollicitor or a Serjeant coming to him to demand money of him on the behalf of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, <hi>goes readily out to meet him, and receives him as coming on the behalf of his Creditor,</hi> for otherwiſe he would not have regarded him at all; he hath alſo reaſon to ſay,
<hi>that if he invite him, uſe him kindly, and make any entertainment for him, this proceeds not from any good will;</hi> but rather as from force and conſtraint, and that he doth not this <hi>for the love of the Sollicitor, nor for his ſake who employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him;</hi> but for love of himſelf and reſpect to his own intereſt, to try <hi>to gain the Sollicitor and win him</hi> by his means. He could not have expreſt his opinion bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I ſhould have been troubled to find a more appoſite compariſon and clearer words to expreſs the exceſs thereof, than thoſe whereof he himſelf makes uſe. He would have us ſay then that when Jeſus Chriſt ſaith in S.
<hi>Matthew, c.</hi> 10.
<note n="1" place="margin">Qui reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Prophetam in nomine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetae, merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Prophetae accipiet; &amp; qui recipit ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum in nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne juſti, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedem juſti ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiet; &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque potum dederit uni ex minimis iſtis, calicem aquae frigidae tantum in nomine diſcipuli: Amen dico vobis non perdet mercedem ſuam. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi>
41.</note> 
                     <hi>That he who receives a Prophet in the quality of a Prophet, ſhall receive a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the quality of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righteous mans reward; and whoſoever ſhall give only a cup of cold water unto the leaſt Diſciple in the quality of a Diſciple, verily he ſhall not loſe his reward;</hi> he intends to ſay no other thing but that we ſhould receive Prophets, righteous men, and Diſciples, and all thoſe who come on his behalf, in ſuch manner as a poor man receives Serjeants, Purſevants, and Sollicitors who come to demand money on the behalf of his Creditors.</p>
                  <p>Finally he concludes his anſwer in theſe words:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22280"/>
                     <hi>Some for want of a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding have taken theſe words and ſuch like from the mouth of our Lord in the Goſpel,</hi> in nomine meo, propter me, <hi>as if they could ſignifie no other thing in our tongue, than for the love of me, and to pleaſe me. What an abſurdity is this! how can they take them in that ſenſe in the</hi> 16. <hi>of S.</hi> Mark, <hi>where it is ſaid,</hi> In nomine meo daemonia ejicient, <hi>In my Name ſhall they caſt out devils: and in the</hi> 5. <hi>of S.</hi> Matthew,
<hi>where the words run thus:</hi> Mentientes propter me, <hi>Lying for my ſake. It is our Lord who ſpeaks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since it is our Saviour who ſpeaks, he ought to have heard him with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; and if he did not underſtand his words, he ſhould at leaſt not have made him ſpeak the quite contrary to what he ſaith. But he wants yet more humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than underſtanding. For if he had never ſo little ſubmiſſiveneſs and doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, we might ſend him to the Holy Fathers and Interpreters of Scripture, to learn the ſenſe of this paſſage. But there were cauſe to fear that ſeeing they all
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46318:153"/>take it in that manner which he condemns, and hold that this which our Lord ſaith <hi>in nomine meo &amp; propter me,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>that which he doth for the love of God and to pleaſe him,</hi> his zeal would tranſport him againſt ſo many Saints and great Perſonages, and make him exclaim; <hi>What abſurdity is this!</hi> or as he doth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: <hi>This is a meer viſion.</hi> For theſe are his common anſwers when he hath no better. So expunging out of Gods Law all command and obligation to love him, he reduces all Religion to this, to ſerve him in keeping the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and doing good Works outwardly.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Leſſius</hi> will not have Chriſtians obliged to external good works themſelves, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22290"/> nor unto thoſe which are the principal and moſt recommended in the Scripture, to wit, the works of mercy. And perceiving this ſtrange Doctrine to be condemned by the mouth of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who in the 25. of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> brings no other reaſon for the ſentence of life or death eternal which he will pronounce at the end of the world upon the Elect and Reprobates, than the accompliſhment or omiſſion of theſe works; he choſe rather to contradict and clude this laſt and dreadful ſentence, than by correcting his errour to ſubmit himſelf thereunto, for he is not aſhamed to ſay that the reaſon which Jeſus Chriſt alledges, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he grounds his judgment is not true, and takes not place in the matter wherein he alledges it, that is to ſay, in the laſt Judgment. <hi>It is not to purpoſe,</hi>
                     <note n="1" place="margin">Nec refert quod Dominus Matth. 25. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam judicii deſcribens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minerit potius operum miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae quam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum.

For he doth it only to ſtir up men, and eſpecially the common people who are not capable of comprehending ſpiritual things, to exerciſe theſe works in this life. Now this reaſon cannot take place at the laſt Judgment; becauſe then there will be no need to excite men unto works of mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not ſtay here to examine this exceſs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22300"/> which will appear ſtrange enough of it ſelf to them who are not void of the common reſentments of Chriſtianity; becauſe it will be more proper to do it elſewhere.

                  <p>Father <hi>Adam</hi> hath ſurpaſſed all his Brethren in the ſame exceſs. For he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys not only the letter and the ſenſe of Scripture, he fights with the Authors themſelves whom God hath made uſe of to impart them to us. He decrys them and deprives them of all that authority and credit which is due unto ſacred Writers, and who were no other than the hand and tongue of the Holy Ghoſt, by attributing unto them weakneſſes and extravagancies; and affirming by an horrible impiety, that following their own imaginations and paſſions, they are ſometimes tranſported beyond truth, and have written things otherwiſe than they were, and that they did neither conceive nor believe them themſelves in their conſciences.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22310"/> It will not eaſily be imagined that this conceit could ever come into the mind of a Monk I will not ſay, but of a Chriſtian who had not entirely renounced the Faith and Church, if this Father had not written it in manifeſt terms, and more forcibly than I can repreſent it, in a Book whereto he gives this Title: <hi>Calvin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by himſelf.</hi> In the third Part of this Book, Chap. 7. he ſaith, <hi>That it is not only in criminal matters that zeal and hate inflame a Soul and tranſport it unto exceſt and violence; but that the Saints themſelves acknowledge that they are not exempt from this infirmity: And flagrant paſſions ſometimes puſh them on to actions ſo <pb n="274" facs="tcp:46318:154"/>ſtrange, and ways of expreſſing themſelves ſo far removed from truth, that thoſe who have written their lives have called them holy extravagancies, innocent errours, and Hyperboles more elevated than their apprehenſions, and which expreſſed more than they intended to ſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He adds alſo in the ſame Chapter, and in the progreſs of the ſame diſcourſe, <hi>That this infirmity is not ſo criminal, but that God did tolerate it in the perſon of thoſe Authors whom he inſpired, and whom we call Canonical, whom he left to the ſway of their own judgments, and the temper of their own ſpirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He compares the Saints and Fathers of the Church to perſons full of paſſions and violence, he excepts not the Canonical Authors themſelves, and he makes them all ſubject to the ſame infirmities, and the Canonical Authors alſo to the greater and more inexcuſable. For if they be vicious in others, they are yet more in theſe, in whom the leaſt faults and the leaſt removes from the truth, which in ordinary perſons were but marks of infirmity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22320"/> would be as notorious and criminal as the greateſt, becauſe they would be imputed unto God whoſe words the Canonical Authors have only rehearſed: and it is as unworthy of God, contrary to his nature and power to depart a little as much from the truth.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore manifeſt, that what this Jeſuit ſaith tends directly to deſtroy all Holy Scripture, Faith, and Religion. <hi>For if the Canonical Writers could exceed and depart a little from the truth</hi> in one ſingle point, they were ſubject to do it in all the reſt. So their diſcourſe is not of divine Authority, neither are their Books the Books or Word of God, becauſe God is always equally infallible, and can never go beyond or depart from the truth in the leaſt, whether he ſpeaks himſelf or by the mouth of his Prophets.</p>

                           <head>SECTION I. <hi>That there is no Command to love God, according to the Maxims of the Jeſuits Divinity.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>OUr Lord ſpeaking of the double Commandment of Love ſaith, <hi>That all the Law and the Prophets do depend thereon: In his duobus mandatis univerſa lex pendet &amp; Prophetae,</hi> Matth. 22. He ſaith not that the command to love God doth depend on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22340"/> and is contained in the reſt; he ſaith on the contrary, that other Precepts are contained in this of love, and depend on it. He ſaith not that to love God is to ſerve him, and do what he commands in any ſort, though it be without love; he teſtifies rather, that to love him with all our heart is to ſerve him and fulfil all his Commandments; becauſe the deſire to diſcharge our duty which is contained in love, ſupplies the place of all outward ſervices which we cannot but would perform if we were able.</p>
                           <p>The Jeſuits on the contrary teach that the Command to love God depends on, is compriſed in, and confounded with the reſt. They ſay that to love God, ſo much as we are or can be obliged by God himſelf, is only to obey him in his other Commands, though it be done without love: That it is ſufficient love of God to do nothing againſt him: That to diſcharge our duty and what the Holy Scripture ordains in this point, it ſuffices not to hate him: As to what remains, it is left to every ones liberty in particular to love him if he liſt, and when he pleaſes, ſo that no perſon in the whole courſe of his life can ever be obliged by the Precept of loving God above all things: ſo that he ſhould not ſin at all againſt this Commandment, <hi>who never put forth any inward act of love,</hi> as Father
<hi>Sirmond</hi> affirms in his Book of the Defence of Vertue, tr. 2. pag. 15. So that though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it would be <hi>a happineſs to love God actually more than all things, yet provided we offend him not, he will not damn us,</hi> pag.
16. And finally <hi>that it is in this manner that God might and ought command us his holy love,</hi> pag. 24.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22350"/> Theſe paſſages and many others beſides which I have related in the former Chapter which treats of the Corrupting of Holy Scripture by the Jeſuit-Authors, are ſo clear, that there needs no explication for underſtanding them. They are ſo expreſs and formal, that without drawing any conſequences from them which they do contain, they that read or hear them only, may eaſily perceive that they tend directly to aboliſh the Command of loving God. Nevertheleſs becauſe we have to do with a people who pretend to meaſure all by, and attribute very much to their own reaſon, I will alſo make uſe of it as they do, and I will imploy their own againſt them or rather with them, that I may the better detect their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions upon this Point, and make appear more clearly the falſe Principles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they teach that there is no abſolute Command to love God.</p>
                           <p>The firſt Diſcourſe of Father <hi>Anthony Sirmond</hi> is this: <hi>If there be a Command to love, it obligeth to the obſervation thereof, by its own Authority,</hi> I mean, it obligeth us to love God.</p>
                           <p>Now during the whole life of man there is neither time nor occaſion wherein we are obliged to love God; becauſe as he ſaith, pag. 16. <hi>God commanding us to love him contents himſelf, as to the main, that we ſhould obey him in his other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and that becauſe God hath not obliged us abſolutely to teſtifie our affection to him otherwiſe than by yielding obedience unto him,</hi> pag. 18. And becauſe though we have no love for him <hi>effectually, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22360"/> we ceaſe not for all that to fulfil in rigour the command of love by doing good works: ſo that we may ſee here the goodneſs of God. He hath not commanded us ſo much to love him as not to hate him,</hi> pag. 19. And becauſe a <hi>God ſo loving and lovely commanding us to love him, is finally content that we obey him,</hi> pag. 28. And by conſequent, according to this Jeſuit, there is no abſolute Commandment to love God, <hi>ſince we are not bound to the obſervation of it by any Authority of its own,</hi> as he pretends.</p>
                           <p>Another Argument taken alſo out of Father
<hi>Sirmond</hi> is this: Every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <pb n="276" facs="tcp:46318:155"/>carries ſome threatning with it, to keep them in their duty to whom it is made, and then ſome penalty or puniſhment againſt thoſe who violate it. Now the Commandment which God gave us to love him, contains neither threat nor puniſhment, at leaſt no grievous one. And by conſequence we cannot ſay that this is a Commandment truly ſo called.</p>
                           <p>The firſt Propoſition of this Syllogiſm is certain and evident of it ſelf. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this you ſhall find alſo in Father
<hi>Sirmond,</hi> tr. 2. pag. 20. &amp; 21. where he diſtinguiſhes of two ſorts of commands; the one <hi>of indulgence,</hi> which requires ſomething without ſtrict obligation thereto; the other <hi>of rigour,</hi> which abſolutely obligeth to what it hath ordained. And to expreſs himſelf more fully, he adds afterwards, <hi>that he commands as much as is poſſible, but without threats, without adding any penalty, at leaſt any grievous one to him who diſobeys. His command is all honey and ſweetneſs:</hi> or to ſpeak more properly, this is only an advice, <hi>when he adds a penalty or commination of death, then it is given in rigour.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſecond Propoſition is his alſo,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22370"/> and more expreſly than the former in the 14. page of the ſame Treatiſe, where after he had ſaid by way of inquiry: <hi>If there be any command to love God, it muſt oblige by its own Authority to its obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He puts this Queſtion: <hi>And ſome one may demand: And to what is he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by his tranſgreſſion? Sins he mortally againſt this Precept, who never exerciſes this inward act of love?</hi> And he anſwers thereupon in theſe terms: <hi>I dare neither affirm nor deny it of my ſelf.</hi> Indeed the anſwer he was about to give to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was too impious to proceed from the Mouth or Pen of a Jeſuit. He had need to uſe or rather to abuſe the Authority of ſome great Saint to cover it, and to make him ſay by force and againſt his judgment, what he durſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of himſelf. S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaith he, 22. <hi>q.</hi> 44.
<hi>a.</hi> 6. <hi>ſeems to anſwer no: and to be content for avoiding damnation, that we do nothing otherwiſe againſt ſacred love, though we never in this life produce any formal act thereof.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeaks not of this in the place he quotes, but ſpeaks rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And how could S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſay that no man is ever obliged to love God at all in his whole life, ſince the whole world knows that he held, That all men are obliged to turn unto God and to love him as ſoon as they begin to have the uſe of reaſon.</p>
                           <p>Notwithſtanding this he forbears not to repeat the ſame thing and to confirm it alſo in theſe terms, ſpeaking of Charity and the Love of God: <hi>He commands us not, as we have ſaid, if S.</hi> Thomas <hi>may warrant us, to love God under pain of damnation.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22380"/> It is ſufficient for him to ſave us that we habitually cheriſh it in us by the obſervation of his other Laws,</hi> pag. 77. and in the 24. pag. God would <hi>be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved freely; if he threats, it is that he may be obeyed.</hi> And alſo, pag. 16. <hi>To love God actually more than all, O the felicity! If not</hi> (that is to ſay, though we never have the felicity to love him actually) <hi>provided we do not otherwiſe offend him, he will not damn us.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Whence we muſt conclude according to theſe Principles and Reaſonings, that there is not abſolutely any true Command which obliges us to love God, ſince that which he hath given us himſelf contains neither threat nor penalty, at the leaſt no grievous one againſt them who fail therein, if you will believe in him rather than S. <hi>John,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Son of God himſelf, who ſay the contrary in ſo many places of Scripture.</p>

                           <p>AFter Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> had reduced this great and firſt Command of God to a ſimple advice and no more; this advice is alſo of ſo little conſequence in his Judgment and according to the mind of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, if you will <pb n="277" facs="tcp:46318:155"/>believe this Jeſuit, that he hath ſcarcely mentioned it in the whole Goſpel. <hi>You will be troubled to find,</hi> ſaith he, pag. 162. tr. 2. <hi>that he hath ſpoken manifeſtly of this divine practice, if it be not at the converſion of</hi> Magdalen, <hi>and in his Sermon at his laſt Supper, where he exhorts us to love him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In theſe two places, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22390"/> which he obſerves as thoſe alone wherein our Lord hath ſpoken <hi>of the practice of the love of God,</hi> he will not have him therein to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it as neceſſary, but only that <hi>he commends it and exhorts us to it,</hi> as a good thing; that is to ſay, that he adviſes, but commands it not.</p>
                           <p>And in this he teſtifies that he hath read the whole Goſpel very exactly, and that he hath very well dived into the ſenſe of the words of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaying to his Apoſtles at the laſt Supper:
<note n="1" place="margin">Hoc eſt praeceptum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ut diligatis invicem. <hi>Joan.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 12.</note> 
                              <hi>The commandment which I give you, is that you love one another.</hi> He diſcovers alſo by his diſcourſe, that he underſtands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well what the Goſpel and new Law is, which according to the Divines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter S.
<hi>Thomas</hi> is no other thing than the Law of love and love it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that when he ſaith that <hi>love is ſcarcely ſpoken of through the whole Goſpel,</hi> it is as if he ſhould ſay that the new Law is not ſpoken of in the new Law, nor the Goſpel in the Goſpel.</p>
                           <p>But to ſhew that he ſpeaks not hereof without having conſidered it well, he obſerves that <hi>of</hi> 32 <hi>Parables, which is the moſt frequent manner of Chriſts diſcourſe, he applies but one for the recommendation of the love of our neighbour, in the perſon of that diſtreſſed poor man abuſed by thieves betwixt</hi> Jericho <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, pag. 121.</p>
                           <p>After he hath read the Goſpel ſo exactly as to number the Parables contained therein: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22400"/> as he hath obſerved only two places wherein our Lord ſpeaks of divine love, ſo he hath found but one wherein he ſpeaks of the love of our neighbour. So that S.
<hi>Paul</hi> had no reaſon to ſay, writing to the <hi>Romans,
<note n="2" place="margin">Plenitudo legis eſt dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio; qui dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git proximum, legem implevit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 10.</note> That love is the fulfilling of the law, and that he who loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law.</hi> For if love be the accompliſhment and fulfilling of the Law, it will follow that love is extended through the whole Law, otherwiſe it could not fulfil nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it all. And ſo it would neither be the fulfilling nor accompliſhment of it: and if the love of our neighbour fulfil and accompliſh the Law, the love of our neighbour muſt contain and be contained in all the Law, as the Soul fills and contains and is filled and contained by the body; which cauſed S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to ſay,

                           <p>WE have now made appear that Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> mingles and confounds Self-love with Charity in the hearts of the Bleſſed themſelves; we muſt now ſee how he changes and transforms alſo love of God into ſelf-love, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges no other Charity but that of Self-love.</p>

                              <hi>But ſay you do deſire him for his own ſake, do you not deſire him for your ſelf? Truly if you reject this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, I by your leave ſhall not do the ſame,</hi> pag. 84. And this perſon replying <hi>that he doth not reject it neither;</hi> that he deſires God indeed, but that he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him that he may be his, and refer all to him; <hi>becauſe he is his Creature and a participation of his Being;</hi> that he would be his, that he might be more obedient and entirely dependent on him: he anſwers him as it were to diſabuſe him: <hi>Conſider that to be of God and to depend on him, ſeems not a motive proper to incline you to deſire the enjoyment of him,</hi> pag. 85.</p>
                           <p>That is to ſay, that they who love God with an hope to enjoy him one day, as all good people in this world do lovehim, or thoſe who already do enjoy him by loving him, as the Bleſſed in Heaven, love him not nor deſire him, that they may depend on him and be his; but to the end that he may be theirs, and after a ſort refer himſelf unto them.</p>
                           <p>He confirms and eſtabliſheth this Principle by another like it, which is, that <hi>none can love any thing beſides his own proper good, and that whoſoever loves hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily a regard to himſelf,</hi> pag. 86. And a little after he grounds his Principle on another Argument which he puts into the mouth of thoſe who are of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Self-love againſt Charity, making them to ſay, that <hi>as good is the object of love, even ſo the private good of every one, is that which the love of every one regards.</hi> Whence he infers without interrupting his diſcourſe, <hi>that if I can deſire nothing but under the appearance of good, ſo no more can I do it without appearance of my own good, I of mine, and you of yours,</hi> pag. 87.</p>

                              </gap> to ſay, that Charity ought to follow the motions of Nature corrupted as it is at this day, and ſtay there. For it is Nature that inclines us always to love our ſelves and for our ſelves: and that ſo Charity gives the ſame inclination, and works the ſame motion in the heart it filleth; ſo that in charitable love as in natural, <hi>the private good of every one is that <pb n="280" facs="tcp:46318:157"/>which every ones love regards,</hi> ſo that no perſon in any ſort whatſoever
<hi>can deſire any thing which is without appearance of ſome private good to himſelf in particular;</hi> that it is <hi>Nature which doth cauſe this,</hi> which being immutable in its Laws which are confirmed and not deſtroyed by Grace, <hi>Charity is to be kept within thoſe bounds.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is true that Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> hath propounded theſe things in the name of another; but this is only to conceal himſelf,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22470"/> having not the confidence to appear as the firſt Author of ſuch ſtrange things; but he was not able to contain himſelf to the end. For after he had made others ſpeak, and ſay all that he had in his mind, he declares that he approves all their opinions. <hi>I am content,</hi> ſaith he, pag 90. <hi>that all they maintain take place even in Charity, that it cannot be inclined towards any object without obſerving and ſeeking therein the proper good of him whoſe heart is inflamed therewith.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He that would undertake to change and transform Charity into Self-love, could not do it more clearly, than by attributing Nature and its motions and the definition of Self-love unto Charity: and Self-love cannot be more naturally ſet forth, than by ſaying with this Jeſuit, that it is a weight or motion of the Soul <hi>which cannot be inclined to any object without obſerving and ſeeking therein the private good of him whoſe heart is therewith inflamed.</hi> So that when he ſaith that he is content that this ſhould take place in Charity, he avows that Charity and Self-love are one and the ſame thing.</p>
                           <p>After this we have leſs cauſe to be aftoniſhed that he hath ſaid, as we have ſeen above, that God <hi>neither ought nor could</hi> command the love of Charity; and that Jeſus Chriſt is come from Heaven to Earth <hi>to ſet us free,</hi> and deliver us from it as a ſlavery and yoke unſupportable. For indeed God could not command Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love; and Jeſus Chriſt is come into the world only to fight with and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it.</p>
                           <p>In this the conſequence and connexion of the Principles of the Jeſuits Divinity is very obſervable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22480"/> and we may obſerve the oppoſition alſo which they have to Faith and Chriſtian Piety, ſince they deſtroy and entirely aboliſh Charity which is the foundation and top-ſtone, the Soul and Spirit of Religion.</p>

                        <p>AS to love any one is to deſire his good; ſo to love ones ſelf is to deſire good to ones ſelf.

                           <hi>Amicus</hi> ſaith the ſame thing, and brings the ſame reaſon for it;

                           <hi>That a man would be always in trouble to know whether he bore love towards God in a higher degree than towards any creature.</hi> It ſeems theſe people have taken for their task, not to teach men their duty, and to carry them on to the performance of what they ought, but rather to diſpenſe with them therein when they find any trouble or difficulty to perform it. Which thing they do in the greateſt part of the moſt important Precepts of Chriſtianity. For men believing them to be too perfect and difficult for them, look for nothing but to be diſpenſed with in their obligation unto them; inſtead of repreſenting unto God their inability, and to pray him to give them force and grace to bear themſelves therein as they ought.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Amicus</hi> enlarges himſelf yet farther on this reaſon. For ſpeaking of two ways of loving God above all things; to wit, by loving him as much as we can by his common aſſiſtance, or by loving him indeed at the leaſt more than any creature:

                        </p>
                        <p>If it be impoſſible to love God as much as we can, or more than any creature, as this Jeſuit pretends, it is impoſſible to love him with all our heart and all our might, and to love him as much as can be above all things, and to love him more than any creature, is but the ſame thing. He would ſay then that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep the firſt Commandment of God, in the manner God himſelf hath injoyned us to obſerve it. Which is not only ſimply to deſtroy it, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, as we may ſay, below nothing, by maintaining that it is not ſo much as poſſible; ſince God cannot command that which is impoſſible, as he himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it.</p>
                        <p>We are not to wonder, if preſuppoſing that it is impoſſible to love God as he hath commanded as, he conclude that we are not at all obliged thereunto.

<hi>num.</hi> 19. Etiamſi nonniſi remiſſe in talem actum tendat.</note> That This is ſufficient in effect to enable us to ſay that we love God above all things, and that we are ready to quit and loſe all things rather than offend him, and therefore to accompliſh the firſt and great Command of Divine love: And that to love God more, is an advice and not a command; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence no man is obliged thereto.</p>
                        <p>I undertake not to examine here theſe Maxims and Arguments, becauſe I have already ſaid ſomething of them in another place. I repreſent them here, only to diſcover according to the deſign of this Chapter, that the Jeſuits have taken in hand to blot out of the Goſpel the principal and greateſt Commandment which obligeth us to love God with all our heart, and with all our ſoul, and with all our might; and they ſay on the contrary, that we cannot love God ſo little as not to ſatisfie this Commandment.</p>
                        <p>God declares that he will be loved <hi>with all our heart,</hi> that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22530"/> with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of our affections; <hi>with all our might,</hi> that is to ſay, as much as we are able. <hi>Amicus</hi> on the contrary pretends that he ought to be content that we love him as little as we pleaſe: becauſe to love him more, (1) <hi>and to a certain degree is only an advice:</hi> It ſufficeth that we love him much under what we could, if we would; (2) <hi>becauſe the leaſt degree of love is enough for him, and for to ſatisfie this Commandment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If this Jeſuit had reſolved to make a Party againſt God, and to contradict and contend with him openly, he could not ſpeak with more violence and evidence: and unleſs he would quite aboliſh and deſtroy the Command which God hath given us to love him with all our heart and all our ſtrength, he could not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and debaſe it more than to reduce it to the laſt extremity, ſaying: <hi>Ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendum praeceptum charitatis erga Deum, ſufficit dilectio, etiamſi in gradu remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſima ſit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But he ſtays not there, and as if he had feared, that he had granted too much unto God in allowing him the leaſt part of our heart and affection, he expounds his thoughts more clearly, and to pacific the conſciences of pious perſons, who might fear they had not the love they ought to have unto God, if they ſhould be obliged to love him in that very manner the Jeſuit ſpeaks of above all things; he adds, that when God commands that we ſhould love him above all things, we muſt not extend this word <hi>all things,</hi> to the rigour in its utmoſt extent and ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its natural ſenſe, ſo that it ſhould comprehend under it all Creatures; but that we muſt underſtand by <hi>all things,</hi> only thoſe which are evil, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22540"/> contrary unto God, and capable to deſtroy the friendſhip which we have with him by Grace and Charity, that is to ſay, mortal ſin only.

                        <p>So that according to this Maxime no perſon is obliged to love God more than any Creature, ſince there is no Creature evil, nor contrary to friendſhip with God; but rather appointed by the Ordinance of God himſelf to help us to know and love him. And ſo according to the Jeſuits we may love all Creatures more than God; and which is more ſtrange, without violating the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which appoints us to love God above all things.</p>
                        <p>If we believe <hi>Amicus</hi> then and his Brethren, there will be nothing but ſin, and that mortal ſin alſo, above which God ought to prevail in our eſteem and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe that only deſtroys the friendſhip we have with him. And if God command us any thing in this matter, and a kinſman, a friend, or any whoſoever <pb n="283" facs="tcp:46318:158"/>deſire the contrary, we may according to this new Philoſophy refuſe God what he deſired of us, to content a kinſman, a friend, or other perſon, without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the friendſhip we ought to exerciſe towards God, provided that this refuſal be not in ſomething expreſly commanded, and of ſuch conſequence that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail thereof without ſinning mortally.</p>
                        <p>It is eaſie to judge whether this be to love God above all things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22550"/> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to love all things above God: and whether an Idea more baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him can be had, than to imagine that we are not obliged to prefer him above any thing beſides mortal ſin only, and that we may love all things more than him without ſin.</p>
                        <p>After he hath brought the love we owe unto God to this point, <hi>Filliutius</hi> adds that we are not obliged to love him in this manner above three or four moments in our life, whereof the firſt is, when we begin to have the uſe of reaſon; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond at the point of death, and the third to love him actually from five years to five years during life. The reſt of the time he allows us to love God or the World, as we pleaſe, confidering the love of God (except at theſe inſtants which he hath ſet down) as a work of Supererogation for which God is beholding to his Creatures.

So that whereas, according to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> fear did render the yoke of the old Law unſupportable, <hi>quam non potuerunt portare patres noſtri,</hi> and love makes the new Law ſweet; <hi>jugum meum ſuave eſt, &amp; onus leve;</hi> we muſt ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Divinity of theſe Fathers, that the old Law was incomparably more ſweet than the Chriſtian, becauſe fear reigned in that, and love <hi>the moſt difficult of all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22560"/> prae caeteris arduus,</hi> in this. Or to ſpeak conformably to their Principles, they are both equally ſweet and eaſie to practiſe, ſince under the one and the other we are equally diſpenſed with for the love of God, and fear bears ſway in both.

                           <hi>Molina</hi> quite overthrows the Divinity of the Apoſtle. For after he hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed fear in the place of love in the new Law, he ſubſtitutes in the old Law love in the place of fear, pretending that it is in this that we may truly ſay thereof, <hi>quam non potuerunt portare patres noſtri;</hi> and that this is the ſpecial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of ours above the old. For this cauſe this obligation to love God only three or four times in our life, ſeems to him alſo too ſevere. This had been well under the old Law; but at preſent that we are under the Law of Grace, we have Sacraments which may ſupply the want of charity and love to God.

                           <hi>That if we reſpect the love which is due unto God, we are obliged unto it by that Law of Nature before death.</hi> That is to ſay, that though in rigour and without any injuſtice a ſinner may remain in his ſin and averſion from God until his death; notwithſtanding he ought of charity to prevent that time, and to love God ſometimes without attending for this extremity, if he will not ask him forgiveneſs as ſoon as he hath offended him, nor even for many years after; it is reaſonable that at leaſt he paſs not above five or ſeven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he do it.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22600"/> and whether be believes he may do this without danger of kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body of his Brother by this delay, and his own Soul by ſo remarkable a negligence; eſpecially if he had an aſſured remedy whereof it was only his own fault if he did not make uſe.</p>
                        <p>I know well at the leaſt, that if herein he pretend not to offend againſt the Laws of Juſtice and Chriſtian Charity, he ſhall tranſgreſs thoſe of the Society, who have ſo well provided for the health of all their Brethren, that inftead of delaying to the extremity, they have ordained to cauſe the Phyſitian to viſit them from time to time, though there be none of them ſick. What kind of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muſt this be which hath ſo great care of the health and life of the body, and ſo little of the Souls?</p>
                        <p>Father <hi>Celot</hi> is not content to ſay as
<hi>Filliutius</hi> and others, that a ſinner is not obliged to ſeek God after he hath offended him; but even that God himſelf preventing and ſeeking, as we may ſay, his friendſhip by the inſpirations and good motions he beſtows on him, he may refuſe and reject them effectually, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out herein making himſelf guilty of any fault. He ſaith alſo the ſame thing of them who make profeſſion of living well, and of all thoſe who of deliberate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe reject the inſpirations and graces by which God inclines them to do any good work, though both the one and the other knew that their Salvation would depend upon theſe inſpirations, and that through neglect of receiving them, and complying with them, they might be loſt eternally.

                        <p>God hath commanded us to love him with all our heart and all our might; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22620"/> that is to ſay, ſo much as we can. The Jeſuits ſay on the contrary, that it is lawful to love him as little as we will, and much leſs than we might if we would, and that this ſuffices; becauſe according to them the leaſt degree of love may ſatisfie this Commandment.</p>
                        <p>As God loves us always, and doth us good without intermiſſion, ſo he would alſo that our love and acknowledgments ſhould be continual and without bounds. But the Jeſuits maintain that we may paſs over whole years without loving him; and that by bethinking our ſelves thereof once in five or ſeven years, we are quit: yea, that though we have never actually loved him at all through our whole life, it ſuffices to diſcharge us from this obligation we have to love him, to think thereof at the point of death; nay, there be ſome who do hardly acknowledge even this obligation.</p>
                        <p>God is not content to be loved in a ſlight way, he will be loved as God, and <pb n="286" facs="tcp:46318:160"/>as he deſerves, above all things. The Jeſuits ſay on the contrary, that we may love all things more than God, becauſe according to their Divinity the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of love ſuffices to acquit us of what we owe him.</p>
                        <p>And when God ſaith that he will be loved above all things, they hold that he would ſay only above all things that are evil and contrary to his friendſhip, that is to ſay, above all ſorts of mortal ſins, which only can overturn and deſtroy the friendſhip which men have with God.</p>
                        <p>As man cannot find his bliſs but in God, ſo he loves not himſelf truly, but ſo far as he loves God, ſeeks, adheres, and is united to him by love: but the Jeſuits diſpenſe with him for this genuine love which he owes himſelf, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22630"/> by diſcharging him of that which he is obliged to bear towards God.</p>
                        <p>They ſay moreover, that being departed from God, he may continue in that eſtate without troubling himſelf about returning to God and himſelf; and that when God ſeeks him firſt by his inſpirations, he may refuſe and reject them, and abide in this eſtate of enmity and voluntary averſion from God until the point of death; and ſo expoſe himſelf to the danger of periſhing eternally, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf by this guilty of any fault, and without being deficient in the love he owes himſelf, any more than in that he owes God.</p>

                        <p>FAther <hi>Bauny</hi> in his Sum, Chap. 7. pag. 81. expounds the Command to love our Neighbour in theſe terms: <hi>By Charity we are obliged to teſtifie unto him who may have offended us, that we retain no animoſity againſt him, and according to the convenience of times and perſons give him proofs of the love we bear him.</hi> He quotes ſome Divines from whom he hath taken what he ſaith; and he adds rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon grounded on the Example and Authority of the holy Fathers. <hi>For love,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which we bear towards our brethren, ought to reſemble that which the members have one towards another, as writes S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>in the</hi>

                        <p>See here the duties of Charity towards our Neighbour, which he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Divines and holy Fathers, and then he eſtabliſheth the command and obligation: <hi>It is even hereunto that God and Nature obligeth us, ſaith S.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>in the firſt Book of his Offices, Chap.</hi> 28.

                        <p>Perhaps it will be wondred at, at firſt, that I having undertaken to repreſent only the Errours of the Jeſuits, have rehearſed theſe places of Father <hi>Bauny,</hi> as if I had ſomething to reply againſt them. But I do not pretend to reprove him for producing the opinion of the holy Fathers with thoſe of the School-Divines, that he might eſtabliſh one of the principal points of Chriſtian Morality. I have no other deſign than to make him ſee clearly the exceſs wherewith he is tranſported by voluntarily deſpiſing the Doctrine of the holy Fathers after he hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it, ſince he hath confidence to ſay afterwards:

                        <p>He ſpeaks alſo of Envy with the ſame ſpirit, citing alſo S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but only to deſpiſe their Authority alſo, by openly preferring his own opinion before that of theſe great Saints. For after he hath related the words of S.
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> who wondring at the nature of Envy, crys out: <hi>Qualis eſt animi tinea zelare in altero felicitatem, in malum proprium bona aliena convertere, illuſtrium proſperitate torqueri?</hi> He adds ſpeedily after, as thinking ſtrange at S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> wondring, and correcting the opinion of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> whom he quotes likewiſe: <hi>This ſin, though by the teſtimony of S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>it be contrary to Charity, yet ſeems not to be mortal,</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22660"/> pag. 80. And the reaſon he oppoſes to the Authority of theſe great Saints, is:
<hi>Becauſe the good which is found in theſe temporal things, is ſo ſlender and of ſo little conſequence for Heaven, that it is of no conſideration with God and the Saints.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I let paſs this reaſon of which I have ſpoken in another place, to relate that which he adds alſo concerning the ſin of Envy. <hi>It is no more mortal,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when a man gives way to ſuch deſires upon ſome good motive, ex bono motivo.</hi> He expreſſes a little before ſome of theſe deſires which he doth not only diſcharge of mortal ſin, but which he juſtifies abſolutely, and would have to paſs for innocent, ſaying that <hi>we may wiſh evil to our neighbour without ſin, when we are urged to it by ſome good motive,</hi> pag. 77. And to expound and ſupport his opinion, he makes uſe of the Authority of
<hi>Bonacina</hi> writing in theſe terms: <hi>So</hi> Bonacina <hi>upon the firſt Commandment, diſp.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 7. <hi>exempts from all fault the mother who deſires the death of her daughters, quod ob deformitatem aut inopiam nequeat juxta animi deſiderium eas nuptui tradere; or indeed becauſe for their ſakes ſhe is ill uſed by their father: quia occaſione illarum male ſecum agitur à marito, aut injuriis afficitur. Non enim proprie filias deteſtatur ex diſplicentia ipſarum, ſed in deteſtationem proprii mali,</hi> pag. 77.</p>
                        <p>He brings alſo another Example on the ſame ſubject:
<hi>alſo one may without fault deſire ſome evil to befal a wicked man, as death; non quidem optando quatenus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ipſius eſt, ſed quatenus boni rationem habet.</hi> This good or this appearance of good which ſerves for motive to deſile the death of a man without offending God, is expounded by
<hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> in this ſort.

                           <hi>You may deſire the death of an enemy who might do you much hurt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22670"/> not of hatred to him, but to avoid the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and hurt which he would do you. You may alſo rejoyce in his death, becauſe of the good which you receive thereby.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was far off from this Doctrine, when in the Goſpel he forbids us to render evil for evil, and commands us on the contrary to do good for evil: But this Maxime juſtifies the greateſt part of the enmities and mortal feuds that are in the world. For commonly we deſire not the hurt, and eſpecially not the death of another, but to deliver our ſelves from ſome evil, or to reap thereby ſome good, and he muſt have loſt all regard of God and Nature, who ſhould deſire any evil or death it ſelf to befal a man out of a meer frolick, without occaſion, reaſon, or hope of any good.</p>
                        <p>I might here alſo repreſent that the Jeſuits diſpenſe with the obligation of aſſiſting our neighbour, except only in extream neceſſity, and that they cheriſh the licence of committing, without fear of puniſhments, theſts, murthers, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, cheats, and breaches of truſt in all ſorts of condition. For all theſe abuſes and all theſe ſins are againſt the Command which God hath given us to love our neighbour as our ſelves, and never to do unto him what we would not have done unto us. But becauſe all theſe things have been largely proved in other places, I will ſpeak no more of them at preſent.</p>
                        <p>I will add only for concluſion unto this Chapter, that which <hi>Amicus</hi> ſaith upon <pb n="288" facs="tcp:46318:161"/>a queſtion which he propoſeth concerning the command to love our neighbour; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22680"/> to wit,

                        <p>After he hath quoted the Divines who hold the affirmative, and related their reaſons to the number of five which are very conſiderable, he cites <hi>Suarez, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninck,</hi> and ſome others who are of the contrary opinion, with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in theſe terms.

Do unto men whatſoever ye would they ſhould do unto you.</hi> As if Jeſus Chriſt commanding us to do good unto our neighbour, did diſpenſe with us from loving him from the bottom of our hearts, or as if he had not commanded the one as well as the other; and yet more expreſly to love him than to do him good, as it may appear in many places of the Goſpel, as in the 13. of S. <hi>John.

                           <hi>All the world ſhall know that you are my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if you love one another.</hi> And without alledging other paſſages of Scripture upon this point, that alone which this Jeſuit abuſes to ſhew that God commands us only to ſerve and not to love our neighbour, doth abſolutely prove our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation unto both. For as there is none who deſires not to be relieved in his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, ſo there is none who deſires not to be beloved and to be ſerved with affection, and there are many who had rather not be ſerved at all, than without affection and with regret, or with indifference. When God then commands men and ſaith:
<note n="5" place="margin">Quaecunque vultis ut faciant vobis homines, &amp; vos facite illis.</note> 
                           <hi>Do ye unto men whatſoever ye would they ſhould do unto you,</hi> he commands as well to love as to ſerve, becauſe there is none that deſires not you ſhould do to him the one as well as the other.</p>
                        <p>He proves his opinion alſo by this reaſon:
<note n="6" place="margin">Probatur autem haec ſententia primo, vi hujus praecepti non tenemur diligere proximum aliter vel plus quam nos ipſos. Atqui nos ipſos non tenemur diligere actu interno charitatis. Ergo nec proximum. <hi>Ibid. num.</hi> 15.</note> 
                           <hi>We are not obliged by this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to love our neighbour otherwiſe or more than our ſelves. Now ſo it is we are not obliged to love our ſelves with a love and internal act of Charity.

                        </p>
                        <p>He alledges another Reaſon and Argument in this manner:

                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, his laſt reaſon is,
<note n="8" place="margin">Multi damnarentur ex eo quod hujuſmodi actum internum charitatis erga omnes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines non elicuerint, quod eſt argumentum ab abſurdo &amp; improbabili. <hi>Ibid. num.</hi> 18.</note>

                        <p>To avoid Witchcraft in theſe prayers, <hi>Tambourin</hi> requires two conditions.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22730"/> and to have a probable commerce with him, and to hope that he will help us, provided we be not wholly confident of it, the Devil not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming always what he would, no more than what he ſaith and what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth. The other condition is, <hi>that the vain Ceremonies be cut off, if there be any.</hi> But the Devil regards not to employ vain and Pagan Ceremonies in Magick, when it is more advantagious for him to uſe thoſe of the Church. 1. Becauſe thereby he profanes the ſacred ſigns of our Religion. 2.

                        <p>There can be nothing more proper to authorize this pernicious Science, and to give it free paſſage through the world, than to ſay that it is capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting Church-men in the greateſt and holieſt Charges of Religion.

                        <hi>BAuny</hi> treating of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in Chap. 6. of his Sum, pag. 69. <hi>acknowledges that we ſee but too many people who by utmoſt infidelity renounce God;</hi> but he adds alſo ſhortly after, that
<hi>the raſhneſs of the tongue or mind in fits and ſallies of choler, which are the cauſe a man is not maſter of himſelf, excuſe from mortal ſin,</hi> this extream infidelity of thoſe who renounce God:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22760"/> and this ſame excuſe may ſerve in a manner for all thoſe who are tranſported to renounce or blaſpheme God, there being few who do it in cold blood.</p>
                     <p>He hath written alſo in the ſame Page, <hi>That by a moſt pernicious abuſe it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a cuſtom in the world to affirm doubtful things by theſe words; As true as there is but one God, which cannot be conſiderately uttered without the ſin of blaſphemy.</hi> He acknowledges the Commandment neither to ſwear nor blaſpheme, and the ſin committed in the violation thereof; but he aboliſheth it as ſpeedily, adding that <hi>this ſin is mortal when there is an intention therein aequandi humanam verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem divinae,</hi> to equalize the truth of humane things to Gods.</p>
                     <p>This Clauſe is remarkable; <hi>When we have an intention.</hi> For it preſuppoſes that when we have not this intention, there is no mortal ſin. And to expound and eſtabliſh this Doctrine yet farther, he brings this reaſon: <hi>Becauſe this is againſt his ſacred honour, and the reverence which we owe him, to compare uncertain and mutable things to the conſtancy and eternal duration of his immutable and divine Eſſence:</hi> (Sanchez <hi>in the</hi> 1. <hi>Part of his Sum in the Book of an Oath</hi>) <hi>and by neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence to attribute unto him that inſtability which is contrary to his perfection and holy Nature, and ſo to blaſpheme,</hi> pag. 70.</p>
                     <p>He always meaſures blaſphemy by the intention of him that commits it; ſo that, according to him to conclude that any perſon offends mortally in uttering theſe words: <hi>As true as there is but one God,</hi> or other ſuch like, it is neceſſary that he have an expreſs intention <hi>to attribute inſtability unto God,</hi> and that he believe that God is as mutable and inconſtant as the Creatures. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22770"/>
                        <hi>Which they do not for all that,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who by this form of ſpeech, would not compare any thing unto God, but only ſhew indeed that the thing is true in a certain manner, as it is true that God is.</hi> And by conſequence they blaſpheme not by the Principles of this Father; As if the ſin of Blaſphemy could not be committed, but when by an errour of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or a falſe opinion of God, or by affected malice, or a formed deſign to deſtroy and diſhonour him, he is blaſphemed. If this be ſo, then to be Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers we muſt become Hereticks, or rather Atheiſts, or Devils.</p>
                     <p>He expounds himſelf yet more clearly upon this very matter in the 66, 67, and 68 pages of the ſame Chapter, where giving out Rules of Practice for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, he ſaith, <hi>That he ought to inform himſelf of the Penitent who accuſes himſelf of blaſphemy, whether he have done it with a formal intention to diſhonour God; and whether he were maliciouſly affected towards God; and whether he blaſphemed him out of hatred; whether he were touched with any deſpite againſt God.</hi> And he adds in the ſequel, <hi>That if the Penitent anſwer that he hath not been touched with any deſpite againſt God, &amp;c. the ſaid Confeſſor is not to repute him for a Blaſphemer, nor deprived of Grace, becauſe he hath uſed blaſphemous words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in the 66. page, after he hath ſaid, <hi>That it is a ſort of blaſphemy, when we name with contempt, ſhame, and diſhonour the holy and moſt ſacred Members of the Son of God,</hi> he adds in favour of theſe Blaſphemers: <hi>Which they ſeem not to do, who make uſe of them in their common diſcourſe as ornaments of ſpeech, ſaying, Death, Head,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22780"/> Belly, &amp;c.</hi> He confirms his opinion by the Authority of ſome <hi>who hold after</hi> Bonacina, <hi>that to name theſe parts in choler, and not through any indignation <pb n="292" facs="tcp:46318:163"/>againſt God, is no blaſphemy.</hi> His reaſon is, <hi>becauſe in theſe words; By the Head, by the Belly, nothing is uttered concerning God which is falſe, ſince it is true that God being become man hath theſe members; though,</hi> as he ſaid in the beginning, <hi>theſe members be named with contempt, reproach, ſhame, and diſhonour to the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If he could excuſe this crime of all ſin, as well as of Blaſphemies, and make it wholly innocent, it may be he would do it. But not dating to undertake that, he doth at leaſt what he can to diminiſh it, making uſe of <hi>Laymans</hi> Authority, who by his relation, ſaith,
<hi>That this is a ſin of irreverence againſt God, which is but venial when it is without perjury, ſcandal, or danger of ſwearing falſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the end of the ſame p. 66. continuing to give his advice and Rules of Practice to the Confeſſor, he ſaith, <hi>That be ought to examine his Penitent whether he have an ill will and deſpite againſt his Creator.</hi> And in the beginning of the following Page he declares that <hi>his advice is, that if the Penitent declare that his choler hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him to theſe ſcandalous words, we may be perſwaded that in uttering them he hath ſinned only venially.</hi> He ſaith alſo a little after, <hi>That we muſt make the like judgment of thoſe who without conſideration do uſe them;</hi> that is to ſay, that they ſin only venially.</p>
                     <p>Finally, he acknowledges none for Blaſphemers properly but thoſe <hi>who volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, of ſet purpoſe, and knowingly name theſe ſacred members of the humanity of the Son of God, if they do it out of formal contempt, wittingly againſt the truth, in which caſe it is a mortal ſin of blaſphemy or perjury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I let paſs all theſe paſſages without making any reflection thereon; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22790"/> neither do I repreſent them with all their extent, having already related part of them in the Chapter <hi>of the Intention,</hi> where they may be ſeen. I have here only touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in my paſſage, that I might make appear what is the opinion of Father
<hi>Bauny</hi> concerning Blaſphemy, and that to find it ſuch as he ſets it forth, and with the conditions he requires in it, we muſt go into Hell. For we may ſpeak and judge of things by his Principles and Arguments, that he hath taken blaſphemy from the face of the Earth, by multiplying Blaſphemers, and giving them liberty to blaſpheme freely, and means to excuſe themſelves from all the blaſphemies they can commit, if they know how to make uſe of the Rules which he hath taught them.</p>
                     <p>One will ſay that he uſeth no blaſphemous words
<hi>but as ornaments of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi> Another may ſay that he did it
<hi>through choler and deſpite</hi> againſt ſome one whom he will, and not out of any evil affection or <hi>indignation he had againſt God.</hi> The moſt part may ſay that when they let flye <hi>blaſpheming, curſing and deſpitefully railing againſt their Creator,</hi> paſſion and <hi>choler tranſported them unto theſe ſcandalous words.</hi> And if they be all examined, as Father <hi>Bauny</hi> counſels a Confeſſor to examine them who addreſs themſelves unto him, ſaying, <hi>That it is very pertinent to the purpoſe that he may learn of them, and know their intention from their own mouth, and what hath moved them to blaſpheme,</hi> he will, it may be, find none who will not anſwer that he did it not <hi>through any formal intention to diſhonour God,</hi> or through any hatred which he had againſt him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22800"/> nor through any formed deſign <hi>to reproach, contemn, and diſhonour God, or Jeſus Chriſt, or his moſt holy and ſacred members.</hi> And thus there ſhall no more Blaſphemers be found in the world, and we muſt no more have recourſe to the Ordinances of the Church, nor of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to puniſh Blaſphemers, nor count that amongſt the Commandments of God which forbids blaſphemy; ſince according to the Divinity of this Father, there will be none in effect, they will be only ſins of irreverence and venial.</p>
                     <p>The other Jeſuits ſeem more moderate on this ſubject: but if they appear in this leſs to blame, they are, it may be, more indeed, and they are much more dangerous than <hi>Bauny.</hi> For the vice that proceeds to extremity, and is viſible in its exceſs, is only for them that have no conſcience; but it ſurpriſes and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly engages thoſe who have yet ſome fear of God, when it is propounded with ſome temperament, and when it is covered with ſome pretence which ſerves as a reaſon to commit it without ſcruple.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> by Example, in his Moral Divinity, places amongſt Problematick Queſtions, whether all blaſphemy be mortal ſin. And though he rank himſelf <pb n="293" facs="tcp:46318:163"/>indeed amongſt them that hold the affirmative, yet he forbears not to ſay that it is no blaſphemy when

                     <p>
                        <hi>Filliutius</hi>'s reaſon is,
<note n="5" place="margin">Licet aliquo modo ſit contra Dei authoritatem, tamen quia non fit contra illam in ſe, ſicut deſtruitur veritas ejus per mendacium, ſed tantum fit contra illam, non tractando illam cum debita reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentie 3 ideo tantum committitur culpa venialis. <hi>Ibid. num.</hi> 333.</note> 
                        <hi>Becauſe though this oath,</hi> thus made without neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or reverence, <hi>be in ſome ſort againſt the Authority of God; nevertheleſs becauſe it deſtroys it not in it ſelf, as a lye deſtroys his truth, and is not contrary unto him otherwiſe than as it renders him not all the reſpect that is due unto him, it is but a venial ſin.</hi> As if it were a ſmall matter to fail of our reſpect towards God, and to demean our ſelves irreverently towards him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22830"/> and not to be troubled for offending againſt his Authority, provided we do not abſolutely deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>This Author conſiders not that to deſtroy truth in our ſelves, is no leſs a mortal ſin, than to deſtroy it in it ſelf, which is impoſſible. For we are obliged to have it in us as our life, by loving and honouring it: and to chaſe it from us by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or negligence, or by preferring other things before it which pleaſe us more, can be no other than a mortal ſin, ſince this is truly to kill our ſelves, and it in us.</p>
                     <p>And for the Authority of God, it is certain that we cannot indeed deprive him of it, any more than of his Power; and to deny it, were to become a Fool or an Atheiſt. Since then it cannot be deſtroyed in it ſelf, nor in the opinion and judgment of men that have their reaſon found, there remains but one way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <pb n="294" facs="tcp:46318:164"/>it ſo much as may be, which is by contempt, and irreverence which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt it by uſing it indifferently without reſpect to confirm what we ſay, ſwearing without neceſſity or occaſion, and even of meer vanity. So that if in this caſe and theſe circumſtances the ſin committed againſt the Authority of God, and the reverence which is due unto him be a ſlight one, as theſe Jeſuits ſay it is, it ſeems that there can never be any great one, according to them in this matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Filliutius</hi> proceeds farther, and maintains, that to ſwear, not only without occaſion and reverence; but alſo upon ſome bad occaſion, as to affirm by oath that one hath committed murder or adultery, is but a venial ſin. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22840"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe this reaſon of <hi>Suarez</hi> is metaphyſical enough, <hi>Filliutius</hi> relates another, or rather expounds the ſame in another manner, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22850"/> and makes it more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,

For if they had it not, they would perceive what they did in ſwearing, and would make themſelves Criminals.

                     <p>The other Example is of a man who hath need of a Knight of the Poſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a Contract and make it valid,

He finds therein ſome difficulty; but after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the opinion of
<hi>Caſtropalao</hi> who approves this ſort of deſires, he concludes that this opinion is probable enough; that is to ſay, that a child may lawfully and without ſin love his fathers inheritance better than his father himſelf. For if he loved his father better than the inheritance that he hopes from him, he could not rejoyce in the death of his father as in ſome good thing, ſince it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him more hurt than good by taking from him his father whom he loves more than all the eſtate he ſhould receive thereby.</p>

                     <p>It is thus that Lyons, Bears, and Tygers devour men, not ſimply to kill them, and to do them hurt, but for their own proper good, that they may feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their fleſh: yet they ſpare beaſts of their own kind, and in this they are leſs cruel and inhumane than men who are ſo blind and unnatural as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and follow a Doctrine ſo pernicious, and which teaches men to kill, eat, and devour one another through a deſire of any the leaſt temporal intereſt.</p>
                     <p>If this were lawful, as the Jeſuits pretend, there would be no more any true Chriſtian or humane Society.

                        <hi>May an inferior deſire the death of his ſuperior in the Church or Common-wealth,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22970"/> that he may ſucceed in his Office, or that he may be delivered from him, becauſe he favours him not?</hi> Here is the caſe to which he anſwers preciſely and without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in theſe words.
<hi>If you deſire only or receive with joy the effect of this death, to wit, the Inheritance of a Father, the Charge of a Prelate, the deliverance from ſome trouble he procured you, the anſwer is eaſie, that you may deſire all theſe things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and that becauſe you rejoyce not in the evil of another, but in your own proper good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dicaſtillus</hi> durſt not at firſt determine upon this queſtion, becauſe it ſeemed to him uncertain; the Authority and Example of <hi>Caſtropalao</hi> having made him more bold, he approves and propounds it as probable; and <hi>Tambourin</hi> makes thereof a Maxime, in which there is no difficulty at all, <hi>facilis reſponſio.</hi> Thus it comes to paſs, that theſe Doctors who make profeſſion of a complacent Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, go on ſtill advancing, not to the better, but to the worſe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, and labour to ſtretch or rather to corrupt mens conſciences, by ſtretching and corrupting the moſt holy and inviolable Rules of Faith and Morality, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe things probable which in themſelves are incredible.</p>
                     <p>If to deſire the death of ones father be of itſelf a crime, as none can queſtion it, the crime is yet greater when he is carried thereto by ſome wicked motive, as that of having his eſtate, which comes from covetouſneſs and injuſtice, and contains in it alſo a notorious ingratitude: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22980"/> and it is in the ſight of God a kind of theft and uſurpation to deſire to have the eſtate of another, and which is more, of ones father, againſt his will, the appointment of God, and all the Laws of Reaſon and Nature. So that to juſtifie the deſire a child hath of the death of his father, by that which he hath of his goods, is to juſtifie one crime by another wherein many more are alſo contained.</p>
                     <p>This injuſtice and diſorder may appear yet more viſible in the other Example brought by <hi>Tambourin</hi> of an Inferior who deſires the death of his Superior: A Monk, for Example, or a Clerk of his Abbot or Biſhop, that he might enter upon his Office. For the deſire alone of a Charge of this nature, even under pretence of a good motive, as to be ſerviceable unto Souls, is a kind of ambition and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption which renders a man unworthy of that Office which he deſires in that manner, as S.
<hi>Thomas,</hi> after the Scripture and Fathers, doth expreſly teach us; he who hath not this good motive, and deſires to enter by a way ſo odious and criminal, as is the death of his Superior, is not only unworthy of the Office which he ſo deſires, but alſo deferves to be excluded from the Clergy, and even to be chaſed out of the Church, as a rebellious and unnatural child from the houſe of his father, who deſires to ſee his death, though he dares not kill him himſelf. How then can one of theſe deſires juſtifie the other? How can we ſay that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior may lawfully deſire the death of his Superior, if we pretend not that one may be a murderer, becauſe he is an Uſurper, and deſire the death of a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would have his goods, without having either right or capacity, but only an unjuſt and unreaſonable pretence unto the one or the other.</p>
                     <p>This yet ſufficeth not this barbarous and murthering Theology, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22990"/> to permit chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to deſire the death of their father and mother, they permit them alſo to be willing to kill them themſelves, to attempt their lives, and effectually to kill them in ſome caſes.

But if it ought to be taken out of what is neceſſary unto him, in ſuch ſort that it would wholly impoveriſh him, or cauſe him to fall notably below his condition, I would not oblige him at all.....

                           <hi>This Precept contains in it two things according to the explication which our Lord gives thereof,</hi> as the Catechiſm of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> obſerves.
<hi>The one is forbidden us, to wit, Murther; and the other is commanded us, to wit, love and charity towards our enemies, peace with all the world, and patience to ſuffer all ſorts of evils.</hi> The Jeſuits deſtroy theſe two parts of this divine Precept by the pernicious Maxims of their Divinity. For as to the ſecond, they are ſo far from believing that God hath commanded the love of enemies, that they believe not ſo much as that there is any true Command to love our Neighbour in general, nor God himſelf, as we have ſeen whilſt we ſpoke of the firſt Commandment of the Decalogue. And for the firſt part, which is the Command not to kill, they overthrow it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite deciſions which are contrary thereunto.</p>
                        <p>For they generally allow to kill in defence of honour, life, and goods; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23050"/> not only when a man ſees himſelf in a near and evident danger of loſing them, but when it is far off and uncertain. They would not have you ſtay till a man ſmite you, it is enough that he threatens you; it is enough that you ſee him come afar off; it is enough that he offends you with his words, or that you know that he hath a deſign upon your life, honour, or goods, for you to prevent, and kill him with a good conſcience.</p>
                        <p>The allowance they make herein is general and without exception. They grant it to Clergy-men and to Fryars as well as Secular perſons. And to give the greater liberty to the uſe of it, they make it paſs for a right of nature, of which they pretend that any whoſoever may make uſe againſt any other whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, even a Servant againſt his Maſter, a Son againſt his Father, a Monk againſt his Superior, leaving them at their choice to employ all means whatſoever they pleaſe, and which they judge moſt proper for their deſign, whether it be by open force, or by ſurprize, and making uſe of ſecret ways, and by ſervice of other perſons interpoſed, if they will not or dare not themſelves attempt to kill thoſe who do or would do them ſome hurt; as we ſhall ſee by and by. The matter is too large to be compriſed under one ſingle title, wherefore I will divide this Article into five Points, in each of which I will repreſent the Opinions of divers Authors of the Society, beginning with

This is a good diſpoſition wherein to return unto the Altar, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Maſs, to imbrue his hands in the blood of his neighbour, and to come preſently thereupon and lay them on the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and to receive his Blood which he ſhed for his enemies.</p>

                           <p>This judicious Jeſuit requires ſome prudent man to the practice of this ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and humane a Doctrine; he would have one kill in cold blood, after he had well thought of it, without heat or precipitation; and that having well weighed what he goes about, and being prepared for it as an action of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he ſhould follow this rare Doctrine with ſo great ſimplicity, that he ſhould thruſt the ſword into his brothers breaſt, and preſently withdraw it again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any kind of emotion; that he ſhould ſhed his blood, and waſh his hands in it as ſoberly as if it were in water.</p>
                           <p>It is therefore clear enough that all theſe precautions and apparent limitations proceed only from the apprehenſion he hath that this Doctrine which he believes to be good, might become odious by the imprudence and evil conduct of thoſe who know not rightly to make uſe of it.

                           <p>But for fear he ſhould give them any ground of ſcruple by giving them this advice, he advertiſes them that for all that they have a right and liberty to kill as well as the people of the world when they are aſſaulted, and that if there be herein any fault, it is only againſt the reputation of their profeſſion.

                              <hi>Whether a Monk who will not flye, but defends himſelf, ſins againſt juſtice in hurting or killing him who aſſaults him?</hi> He anſwers definitively in theſe terms:
<note n="5" place="margin">Puto non peccare contra juſtitiam, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime ſi vita vel fortunae inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantur. n. 86.</note>

                           </p>
                           <p>He pretends then that a Monk who ſees a Thief take what belongs to him, may kill him without fear of acting againſt Juſtice, though he ſhould do better to pardon him, and ſpare his life withdrawing himſelf or flying:

                           <p>If Charity oblige not in this occaſion, as
<hi>Leſſius</hi> pretends, I know not when it can oblige. Here we are concerned in the ſaving, or rather in the not taking away of a mans life: here we are concerned even in his eternal damnation; and that we may not be the cauſe, or at leaſt the occaſion and inſtrument of this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death, the queſtion is only of the peril of loſing a few goods, or of retiring and flying. The caſe concerns a religious perſon who is aſſaulted, or from whom what he hath would be taken. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23280"/> What ſhould he do in this encounter? Shall he withdraw or defend himſelf? Shall he reſolve to kill him with his own hand who hath taken his goods, rather than ſuffer him to carry them away? <hi>Leſſius</hi> anſwers that he may kill him without fear of ſinning againſt Juſtice. <hi>Puto,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>non peccare contra juſtitiam,</hi> nor even againſt Charity it ſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, becauſe it obliges not hereto. <hi>Charitas non obligat.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>After this we may find it leſs ſtrange which we have ſeen already, that Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> maintains that the Law of Charity obliges us not in rigour always to love God, nor our neighbour, upon what occaſion ſoever; ſince, after <hi>Leſſius</hi>'s Maxims, there are many very ſlender occaſions upon which it is lawful to kill, though we may eaſily abſtain therefrom if we would, and though we ſee clearly enough that from temporal death he paſſeth on to eternal.</p>

It is true I have heard an excellent Father, a Doctor in Divinity of great wit and learning ſay, that</hi> Amicus <hi>might well have forborn to propound this propoſition; but it being once publiſhed in print, he was obliged to maintain it, and we to defend him. This Doctrine indeed is probable, and a Monk may kill a woman with whom he hath ſinned, for fear ſhe ſhould defame him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He ſaith well, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23340"/> that it had been better that <hi>Amicus</hi> had never publiſhed this miſchievous Doctrine, but he ſaith not that it is wicked; and though he ſaw well enough the falfity and errour thereof, as he teſtifies by the difficulty he makes to approve it, yet he believes that <hi>Amicus</hi> was obliged to maintain it after he had publiſhed it, <hi>ſemel impreſſam debet illam tueri.</hi> For that it is a kind of diſgrace to a learned man as he is, and to the Society, to ſeem to have been ignorant of any thing, or to have erred; and a Jeſuit knows not what it is to recant ſincerely when he hath once ſet forth a Propoſition by the order and with the approbation of his Superiors.</p>
                        <p>This Doctrine, though altogether brutiſh and inhumane, ceaſeth not to be probable in the Judgment of this Caſuiſt: <hi>Doctrina quidem eſt probabilis,</hi> becauſe <hi>Amicus</hi> hath ſet it out; and becauſe he who is a Doctor as well as <hi>Amicus,</hi> by the engagement he ſtands in to the party, and that he might gratifie his Maſter and his friend, finds himſelf obliged to give him his approbation: <hi>Et nos debemus candem defendere.</hi> And upon a probability ſo well founded, a Monk may kill a woman with whom he hath ſinned, for fear ſhe defame him. <hi>Poterit Religioſus pellicem occidere ne ſe infamet,</hi> taking from her in this manner her life after her honour, and clearing an adultery by a murder.</p>
                        <p>A Judge cannot put to death a Malefactor, if he be not lawfully and evidently convicted; and if he condemn him upon ſimple conjectures, preſumptions, and probabilities, he makes himſelf guilty of his death. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23350"/> So that the Caſuiſts give more power to a Malefactor and an Adulterer, then the Laws give unto Judges, aſſuring him that he may upon a probable opinion kill her with whom he hath ſinned, for fear ſhe diſcover his crime.</p>
                        <p>This is not ſufficient to have made this opinion probable, he muſt alſo, that the Religious may have entire liberty to follow it without any ſcruple, remove from the contrary opinion all manner of probability; and this <hi>Caranuel</hi> doth, ſaying,

                           <hi>That all able men and learned perſons amongſt them hold with him, not only that the opinion of</hi> Amicus <hi>is true, but that the contrary opinion is not ſo much as probable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It muſt needs be that this opinion which authorizes Murder in favour of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, hath in a little time made a marvellous progreſs, ſince <hi>Amicus</hi> declares that he invented it, and
<hi>Caranuel</hi> not daring at firſt to ſay that he approved it, ſpeaks of it a little after as certain and evident truth, the contrary whereof ſeems not to him to be maintainable, becauſe that upon his and <hi>Amicus</hi> Authority all the learned of the Faction of Probability have embraced it.</p>
                        <p>Then he fortifies this Authority by reaſon, which he propoſes in this manner:

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23360"/> He takes it for granted, that both the one and the other are reaſonable, and that there is no difference but as of leſs and more: That it is an equitable, generous, and holy act to bear falſe witneſs againſt him that aſſails our reputation; but it is more generous and holy to kill him,

                           <hi>I prove alſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the minor, namely, that it is probable that he who bears falſe witneſs to defend his right and his honour, ſins not mortally: for that which is maintained by perſons of piety and learning is probable; and this doctrine hath for it more then twenty great and very learned Perſonages.</hi> Whence he concludes,
<hi>That if we imagine theſe not to be ſufficient to make it probable, we ſhall hardly find any at all that is ſo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Behold a new wonder of the Doctrine of Probability, to prevail not only againſt the opinions of men, but againſt the Law of God and Nature. For this Caſuiſt ſaid a little above, that by the common conſent of the Doctors, a lye is in its nature ſo bad, that God himſelf cannot prevent it from being ſo at all times, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23380"/> nor diſpenſe with the Law which forbids it: And here he would have the opinion of twenty Jeſuits or Diſciples of Jeſuits of force to make it lawful by the Doctrine of Probability, and not only to protect lying, but which is worſe, falſe witneſs alſo againſt the Law of God.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible to advance the Doctrine of Probability any higher, then to elevate it above the Power of God, and to ſubject the Laws of God unto it, by giving it a power to approve what they condemn, and to juſtifie that which God himſelf cannot ſo much as tolerate.</p>
                        <p>I know not whether, as they hold that a Confeſſor is obliged to quit his own opinion to follow that of his Penitent, though he believe it is falſe, if it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſome probability, ſo they do not even pretend alſo that a man who hath killed one to preſerve his honour, coming to appear before God to receive his Judgment, may not oblige him to renounce his own light, and to paſs over his own Laws to abſolve him, by repreſenting unto him, that he could not ſin, following a probable opinion ſupported by the Authority of twenty Doctors.</p>
                        <p>If the Jeſuits be not confident enough to ſay this, yet they muſt needs believe it, or renounce their Doctrine of Probability, ſince it is a neceſſary and evident conſequence of the Maxims of this Science. For as they hold it for certain, that we cannot ſin in following a probable opinion; it is alſo very certain, that an equitable Judge, and by ſtronger reaſon God who is Equity and Juſtice it ſelf, cannot condemn nor puniſh him who ſins not. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23390"/> And by conſequent this man who following the opinion of <hi>Amicus</hi> and theſe twenty Doctors who have approved it, hath ſlain one to preſerve his honour, having not ſinned, God cannot condemn nor puniſh him; but he ſhall be obliged to abſolve him, and give him part of his <pb n="316" facs="tcp:46318:175"/>glory, in yielding to the Authority of theſe Doctors, and giving way to the Rules of Probability, though he judge according to divine light, that his action is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and condemned by the eternal Laws.</p>
                        <p>After this we muſt not think it ſtrange, that they will not ſubmit this marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Doctrine to the Laws of the Church, or Princes, and that they pretend that they are of no force againſt it, as
<hi>Caramuel</hi> declares, anſwering this queſtion:

                           <hi>That the Doctrine of</hi> Amicus <hi>is new, and later than the common Laws; and that by conſequence the Popes, Emperors, and Kings have ordained nothing about this point.</hi> Whence it will follow by the ſame reaſon, that if any one ſhould begin at this day to teach ſome new and heretofore unheard of errour, as to ſay that Blaſphemy or Adultery were no ſin, his opinion would not be condemned by the Church; becauſe it would be new and later than its Laws. When the Church condemns an Errour, it condemns all thoſe who ſhall hold it for the future, as well as thoſe who have held it in time paſt: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23400"/> And it hath truly and ſufficiently condemned this of <hi>Amicus,</hi> in condemning ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and murder which this Jeſuit approves and authorizes.</p>
                        <p>But if the Errour and Crime were not ſo evident as it is in this opinion, its novelty alone, of which this Caſuiſt would make uſe to exempt it from the cenſure of the Church, ſuffices to make us ſee that it is condemned by the Church it ſelf. For there is no Divine who knows not that Novelty, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in matters of Doctrine, hath been always ſuſpected and odious in the Church, and that it hath always rejected and condemned it by the Laws and Mouths of all the Saints which governed it. And by conſequent this opinion of <hi>Amicus</hi> being novel by his own confeſſion, it hath been condemned by the Church before it proceeded from his imagination.</p>
                        <p>After <hi>Amicus</hi> had expounded this pernicious Doctrine ſo largely, built it up with ſo great care, and ſupported it with all the reaſons he could, he thinks to put himſelf under ſhelter by ſaying,

                        </p>
                        <p>But ſeeking to hide, he diſcovers himſelf the more, and his words render him more guilty, ſince he acknowledges this Doctrine is novel, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23410"/> and that he hath not found it in any Author. He therefore by this makes known and declares openly that it is he who invented ſo abominable an opinion. And therefore we may ſay with all truth, that it had its birth in the School of the Jeſuits; that they are the Authors of it, and that it is properly and particularly their Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>And it is to no purpoſe for <hi>Amicus</hi> to ſay, that he doth not ſet on foot theſe Maxims ſo contrary to Juſtice, Nature, and humane Society, but only by way of diſputation, and that he ſubmits his unto others Judgment. For this diſcourſe makes not an opinion good which is bad of it ſelf; and this excuſe and ſubmiſſion hinders him not from being blamable for publiſhing of it; but it only teſtifies that he did this with fear, and that he meant hereby to ſound as it were the minds of men, to ſee how this his firſt Propoſal of it would be received in the world, that he might afterwards declare himſelf more openly, and maintain it with an abſolute confidence, if this firſt draught of his Eſſay ſhould proſper with him, and an opinion ſo ſtrange and odious ſhould only be tolerated.</p>
                        <p>But beſides this, it is an enterpriſe unſufferable and pernicious to the Church and Common-wealth to propoſe ſo horrible Errours and Maxims which carry on unto vice, revenge, and murder, under a pretence that it is done only for diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſake, and for an exerciſe of wit, without determining any thing at all abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.

                        <p>The Stoicks taught indeed that it was lawful to kill ones ſelf rather than loſe his honour, and there are many Examples found in the Hiſtories and Books of the Pagans, of perſons commended for having practiſed this wicked Maxime. But I find no moral Rule nor civil Law in all Heathen Antiquity, which ever tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated what the Jeſuits allow, to kill a man for a thing of ſo ſmall importance as an Apple, ſo often as it falls out that the loſs thereof brings upon us ſome abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of worldly honour.</p>
                        <p>I have not found, I ſay, in all Heathen Antiquity any Philoſophy which hath taught, no Law which hath tolerated this, no more than any Example of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ever did it with the approbation of any ſage perſons. For this cauſe the Jeſuits may boaſt truly, that they have paſſed the bounds, not only of the Fathers of the Church, as they brag openly, but even of all the Heathen Philoſophers, and to have diſcovered Principles, and invented Rules of Morality, which the Pagans deſtitute of faith, by the light of reaſon only would have abhorred and rejected as errours and extravagances.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Vaſquez</hi> believes that he is obliged to extend this ſame power of killing in defence of what belongs to them, unto the Clergy and Monks. <hi>It ſeems <pb n="322" facs="tcp:46318:178"/>to me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that this is lawful for them as well as the Laity,

It is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23570"/> that this is not the Charity which Jeſus Chriſt hath taught us by his Words and Example, which obligeth us to dye for our brethren and for our enemies themſelves, and to prefer the good of their Souls and their Salvation above all our intereſts and all the goods of the world.</p>

                        <p>So that it ſhall not be in one or two caſes only, but in an infinity of occurrents almoſt, that this Command of Killing, which
<hi>Molina</hi> would introduce amongſt Chriſtians, ſhall oblige them under pain of eternal damnation. And it would not be eaſie, according to the Doctrine of this Jeſuit, to exempt from mortal ſin a multitude of holy Martyrs who have ſuffered themſelves to be ſlain unjuſtly, not only without defending themſelves; but alſo ſometimes forbidding thoſe who could and would to defend them; becauſe ſome of them being Fathers of Families, and others Fathers of the Church and of the Faithful, their lives were of importance both in ſpirituals and temporals. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23600"/> So that though they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from their right in Charity, and ſuffer themſelves to be ſlain without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves, yet they could not, according to this new Theology, recede <pb n="324" facs="tcp:46318:179"/>from the right of thoſe who appertained to them, and who were under their Charges, whereunto their lives were neceſſary. And by conſequence if this Jeſuit do not ſhew them favour, and grant them a diſpenſation from this Rule, they ſin mortally in dying for Jeſus Chriſt, and not defending themſelves, and not doing all they could to preſerve their lives, ſo far as to kill, if it were needful, their Aggreſſors.</p>
                        <p>But if he pretend, that this Commandment is from God, as it ought to be, that it may imply ſo great and ſtrict an obligation, we muſt alſo believe that the Law of God is leſs reaſonable and leſs juſt than the Maxims of Philoſophy, and the Civil Laws of Pagans, who never commanded nor taught any ſuch thing, and who rather condemn it in many caſes in which the Jeſuit approves it, as an exceſs and crime; he muſt therefore be conſtrained either to change the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, or to increaſe their number; we muſt, according to him, make eleven Commandments of God inſtead of ten; or indeed inſtead of what hath been ſaid to this preſent; <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> we muſt ſay for the time to come: Thou mayſt kill oftentimes without fear of mortal ſin, and thou ſhalt even be obliged ſometimes to kill on pain of Hell.</p>

                        <p>He propoſeth many exceptions to the Law of God which forbids killing, of which the firſt is this:

                        <p>He expounds himſelf after more clearly, introducing a perſon who ſpeaks in theſe terms:

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46318:180"/>alſo for a Church-man or Monk. For as much as their profeſſion, wiſdom, and vertue, from which the honour of a Clergie-man or Monk proceeds, is more to be eſteemed than skill in Arms, from whence Lay-men draw their honour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Amieus</hi> quoted in this ſame place by
<hi>Eſcobar,</hi> adds alſo to confirm his reaſon, that in this the condition of a Monk is altogether equal to a Lay-mans. <hi>Cum in hoc Religioſus &amp; Secularis fint omnino pares.</hi> But <hi>Eſcobar</hi> forgot theſe words, or rather left them out purpoſely, though they ſeemed favourable enough to the deſign he had of eſtabliſhing unto Monks the right of killing for honour. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt he believed that this would debaſe too much the right of the Monks in this point, to make them equal to Lay-men.</p>
                        <p>For the right of the Monks being grounded,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23680"/> according to him, on their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Vertue; as the Laicks on their valour, and dexterity in managing their Arms; being the Profeſſion and Vertue of Monks is more elevate and more to be eſteemed than the Exerciſe of Arms, it muſt neceſſarily follow by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Amicus,</hi> that the right which the Religious have to kill for honour, being better grounded, ſhould alſo be ſtronger and greater than the Laicks. And by conſequence he ought not to have ſaid, that the condition of the one and the other was altogether equal; but it muſt be concluded by the Principle and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of theſe Jeſuits, that in this the Monks ought to have advantage over the Laicks, and that they may kill with more liberty, and upon leſs occaſion thoſe who invade their honour.</p>
                        <p>And the reaſon hereof is clear. Becauſe the more precious honour is, the more eaſie it is to hurt it, and the fault of him that doth it, is the greater; and as offences which are ſlight, being done againſt private perſons, are very great, and deſerve exemplary chaſtiſement, being done againſt the honour of a Prince or a King; ſo an injury which would not be conſiderable againſt the perſon of a Laick, would be criminal, being done againſt a Monk, to blaſt his or his Orders repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                        <p>By this Rule it is eaſie to judge how far this pretended right may be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23690"/> or rather it will be hard to judge of its ſo great extent. As it will be at the pleaſure of Monks to ſet their honour, vertue, and the reſpect due unto their Profeſſion at what rate they pleaſe, ſo it will alſo be in their power to judge of the greatneſs of the faults which are committed againſt them in this point, and conſequently of the penalty they deſerve who commit them.</p>
                        <p>And if it be lawful for a Lay-man to kill for a matter of ſmall value, <hi>licet ſit res parvi pretii,</hi> as <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſaith, by example, for an Apple or a Crown, <hi>ut pro pomo, vel etiam uno aureo ſervando,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Leſſius,</hi> as we have ſeen; when a mans honour is concerned in the taking theſe things from him, we muſt confeſs that a yet leſſer occaſion, if a leſs can be had than an Apple or a Crown, will ſuffice, according to this Divinity, to give the ſame toleration to a Monk. We need only look ſurlily upon him, do or ſay the leaſt thing to offend him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur his diſpleaſure, and thereupon to dye by his hand, if he pleaſe to make uſe of this right which the Jeſuits attribute unto him, as they alſo uſurp it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and pretend they may uſe it, as we ſhall ſee in the following Point, where we relate the Opinion of Father <hi>Petavius</hi> upon this matter.</p>

                           <hi>That according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome others, which is alſo his own, it is probable that this is lawful; becauſe this Commandment, Thou ſhalt not kill, forbids not abſolutely to kill an innocent; but with this exception, not to kill him without obligation and juſt cauſe, according as S.</hi> Thomas <hi>ſpeaks. Now in this caſe he that kills, doth it not without juſt and very urgent reaſon, ſuch as is the preſervation of his own life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This reaſon may be extended yet farther. For hence it will follow, that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be taken to kill an innocent, not only to preſerve life, but honour and goods; and if he ſhould be blamed, who had done it, he may alledge for his juſtification, that if he had not done this, he had been ruined in eſtate and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whereof the one is neceſſary to life, and the other more dear than life it ſelf; and he will ſay as the Caſuiſt here: <hi>Iſta occiſio non fit ſine juſtiſſima cauſa &amp; urgentiſſima.</hi>

                           <hi>That we are obliged, at leaſt by Charity to flye, if we can, for fear of killing an innocent.</hi> But this language, as we have already obſerved elſewhere, according to the Principles of the Jeſuits Divinity, is not intended to ſignifie any more than that if being aſſaulted, you can flye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inconvenience to you, rather than kill an innocent, in your defence, you ſhall do well, though you are not obliged to it abſolutely, and in doing the contrary, you cannot be blamed of any injuſtice.

                        <p>If this reaſon and this bloody Maxime be current amongſt men in our days, as this Jeſuit ſeems deſirous to make it, by giving it his ſtamp, and teaching it in his publick Lectures, no man can be ſure of his life, or rather there will hardly be any perſon left alive in this world, wherein defamations ſerve for common entertainment, and a flouting humor goes for a vertue.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I will put an end to this Chapter, and cloſe it with ſome remarkable places of a Book which Father <hi>Petavius</hi> cauſed to be printed ſome years ſince, of Publick Penance. For writing after thoſe whom we have already quoted, and ſeeing he could add nothing to the licentiouſneſs of their opinions about Murder, he was minded to ſignalize and make himſelf remarkable above all others, by ſhewing himſelf more audacious than they in the practice and execution of what they had taught.</p>
                        <p>This Doctrine is of it ſelf ſo far diſtant from all reaſon and humanity, that the greater part of themſelves who would have it paſs for true, or at leaſt for probable, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23780"/> have maintained it only in general and in the Theory: and when they more nearly conſidered it in the particular caſes and dire conſequences it drew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, horror and ſhame kept them back, and hindred them many times from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the practice.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps there will be none found beſides Father
<hi>Petavius,</hi> who tranſgreſſing all bounds of moderation, is not content to maintain, as others, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which teaches Murder, is probable, or to approve it in the practice; but he requires and preſſes the execution of it, and purſues it with all extremity of heat againſt a Doctor and Prieſt whom he acknowledges unreproachable in his life, and who could not be criminal in that point upon which he purſues him, if not in this, becauſe he being obliged in Charity and of neceſſity to reprove ſome defaults of the Jeſuits conduct in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments of Penance and the Euchariſt; <hi>that which this Doctor of</hi> Sorbonne
<hi>ſaid, was not pleaſing to him, nor his Brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He would cover his inhumane paſſion with a veil of imaginary good intention. He would have his averſion againſt an innocent perſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23790"/> paſs for a laudable and neceſſary duty. And becauſe he can find nothing in the life of this famous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor which could render him ſo criminal as he repreſents him, he forms againſt him general accuſations, and imputes unto him the greateſt crimes againſt the State and Religion, without any proof, without other foundation than that of his paſſion and blindneſs.</p>
                        <p>He goes yet farther, and to rid his hands of his Adverſary more eaſily, he ſhews a deſire, that the invention of a famous Law-giver might be followed, who ordained, <hi>That if any one would change and innovate any thing in the received Laws, he ſhould preſent himſelf with a Halter about his neck, caſt into a running knot, and having in this manner propoſed his reaſons in oppoſition to them, if they were judged equitable, the Law ſhould be aboliſhed or moderated, and the propoſer come off ſafe; but if his overture were not conſented to, he ſhould be ſtrangled imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and ſo undergo the penalty due unto his unadviſedneſs This courſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>may ſeem too rigorous, but the intent is commendable; nay, it is neceſſary for them in whoſe hands the Government now is.</hi> By this diſcourſe it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, according to this Fathers Morals, that Dr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> having propoſed a Doctrine contrary to that which is in credit amongſt the Jeſuits, deſerved death, and that he ſhould do no other than a very laudable act <hi>who ſhould draw the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knot about his neck</hi> to ſtrangle him; nay, that it is neceſſary for them who have the Government in their hands to act thus, and to make themſelves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the paſſions and intereſts of theſe Fathers.</p>
                        <p>It is an incredible thing, that a Prieſt, a Monk, and a Chriſtian durſt ſpeak in this ſort, and durſt riſe up in a manner ſo cruel and ſhameful againſt a Prieſt and <hi>Sorbonne</hi> Doctor. But it is more incredible, that he would extend this fury, as he makes ſhew of againſt ſo many Biſhops and Doctors who approved his Book of frequent Communion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23800"/> and generally againſt all thoſe who followed and eſteemed the opinions of this Book; that is to ſay, againſt an infinity of learned and pious perſons of all conditions.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be avowed, that thoſe who have allowed Murders, who have given liberty to diſpatch enemies by killing them, were never tranſported to ſo great exceſs, and that there are few men who have in their whole lives committed ſo <pb n="332" facs="tcp:46318:183"/>great and abominable homicides, as this Father, ſo good and gentle, hath a will to do with his own hand.</p>
                        <p>I ſpeak not here, though this ſeems to be its place, of that deteſtable Doctrine which teaches Subjects to kill their Kings, under pretence of their being Tyrants; women great with child, to cauſe the fruit in their wombs to periſh, when they cannot be delivered thereof without endangering their lives; young Maidens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured, to expoſe their children to ſave their credit, which is the Jeſuits Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. I ſhall repreſent all theſe things more conveniently, when I ſhall come to ſpeak in particular of the Duties of every perſon according to his condition.</p>
                        <p>I will only obſerve here, that if the Murder which is committed in all theſe caſes, and in all others which we have formerly related, and extracted out of the Jeſuits Books, be not againſt the Commandment of God which forbids to kill, as the Jeſuits maintain; it will not be eaſie to imagine on what occaſion one may poſſibly break that Commandment, or make himſelf criminal in the violation thereof, if he may kill an enemy, a ſlanderer, a thief, an invader, an informer in falſe crimes, and even in true ones, but ſecret, and which is yet more an innocent perſon, and from whom he never received any diſpleaſure; an Infant, a Prince, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23810"/> a King, all ſorts of Superiors, without excepting Fathers and Mothers.</p>
                        <p>If he may challenge into the field, aſſaſſinate publickly, kill by ſurpriſe or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advantage, cauſe to dye ſecretly, by poyſon, or otherwiſe for the preſervation of his life, honour, or goods, and even for the leaſt thing in the world, as for an Apple, when he believes himſelf obliged in honour not to let him carry it away who hath taken it.</p>
                        <p>I ſay, if one may kill, or cauſe to be killed in all theſe caſes without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſin, as the Jeſuits teach publickly, it will neceſſarily follow, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Maxims, for a man to make himſelf criminal againſt the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which forbids Murder, he muſt kill in a frolick, and without any true or apparent cauſe. Which cannot be ſuitable to any but Devils, and thoſe that have a diabolick malice.</p>

<hi>That Fornication is a mortal ſin, and that to ſay the contrary, is an Hereſie. But whether it be forbidden by poſitive or natural Law; and by conſequent whether it be evil in it ſelf, is a queſtion amongſt the Doctors.</hi> Durand, Martinus de Magiſtris, Caramuel, <hi>and ſome few others believe that it is forbidden by poſitive Law only. But the common opinion and of almoſt all the Doctors is, that it is forbidden by the Law of Nature—As for me I hold two things for certain. Firſt; that the common opinion is true. Secondly, that this truth being preſuppoſed, we muſt ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23830"/> that there is ſome natural reaſon which proves it. But I muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge, that the Principle whence this Concluſion is drawn, is not yet entirely diſcovered. After this manner it is that we are accuſtomed to anſwer concerning ſome ſecrets of Heaven, or the ſquaring of the Circle, or other like queſtions when we diſpute of them in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. <pb n="333" facs="tcp:46318:183"/>For we ſay, that theſe things are certain, and that they may be proved by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative reaſons, but no man hath yet propounded them. I ſay, the Principle whence this Concluſion is drawn. For if the conſequences of it be conſidered, it may be proved manifeſtly enough, principally from this, that if it were not forbidden by the Law of Nature, it might be granted by diſpenſation in ſome very preſſing occaſions, which cannot be ſaid in any wiſe.</hi>

                        <hi>It is probable,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that one may be invincibly ignorant of the precept which forbids fornication, at leaſt amongſt barbarous and groſs-witted perſons. This is the opinion of</hi> Azor
<hi>and</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundez. <hi>The reaſon is, becauſe this precept is not drawn manifeſtly from ſome firſt principle of natural light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſaith firſt of all, that many Doctors, whom he cites, hold, that Fornication is forbidden only by poſitive Law; and by conſequent this opinion is probable, according to him, being ſupported by the Authority of theſe Doctors, who without doubt are not deſtitute of reaſons to prove it.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place he ſaith, the Principle from whence we may infer, that Fornication is evil in it ſelf, and forbidden by the Law of Nature, is not evident; that it cannot be found, or at leaſt wiſe not clearly diſcovered. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23840"/> that this Concluſion is no more evident than its Principle, but is it ſelf only probable. And though it be more probable at this day than the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which hath not ſo many Partizans and Caſuiſts on its ſide, nevertheleſs as it is the more ſweet, that is to ſay, hath more liberty and canformity to the corrupt inclinations of Nature, it may perhaps ſhortly prevail above the other by ſuffrages, and the greater number of theſe new Caſuiſts who profeſs a complacent Divinity, and follow voluntarily the moſt indulgent opinions.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, though it ſhould continue always leſs probable, it is enough that it is ſimply probable, ſince the leaſt or laſt degree of probability ſuffices to be followed with a ſafe conſcience, according to theſe Doctors.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whence it follows evidently, that he who ſhall be of <hi>Tambourins</hi> opinion, may abſolutely demand and receive a diſpenſation for Fornication, as well as for faſting, becauſe it is at leaſt probable, according to him, that neither the one nor the other is forbidden, but only by poſitive Law; and where things are not evil, ſave only in regard they are forbidden, one may with ſome reaſon, and even without any reaſon, according to ſome Caſuiſts, obtain and make uſe of a diſpenſation for it.</p>

                        <hi>That if for want of an evident Principle, which he confeſſes it hath not, one would prove it by conſequences, it may be proved manifeſtly enough, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23850"/> from this principally, that if it were not forbidden by the Law of Nature</hi> (he ſpeaks of Fornication) <hi>it might be indulged by diſpenſation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He produces here as a principal reaſon which may prove it, or rather as a conjecture which may make it believed, that Fornication is forbidden by the Law of Nature, becauſe we cannot have a diſpenſation to commit it. And ſome other time, if the world be better diſpoſed than at preſent, he himſelf or his Society building upon the ſame Principles with him, may eaſily prove, that it may be diſpenſed with; becauſe it is not evident that it is forbidden by the Law of Nature, and that it is even probable, that it is only by poſitive Law, as he declares
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46318:184"/>it himſelf. And ſo Fornication ſhall be in the number of things indifferent; and it may be lawful, when it pleaſes them to employ their Authority and their reaſons, to take away the prohibition which alone renders it evil and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>

                        <hi>That it is probable that there may be invincible ignorance of the precept which forbids Fornication, at leaſt amongſt Barbarians and groſs-witted people. This is the opinion of</hi> Azor
<hi>and</hi> Fagundez. <hi>The reaſon whereof is, becauſe this precept is not manifeſtly drawn from the firſt Principles of the light of Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He alſo ſaid once, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23860"/> that it is neither evident nor certain by way of Principle or by natural Reaſon, that Fornication is evil of it ſelf, and forbidden by the Law of Nature. And from thence he infers, that a man may be invincibly, that is, innocently, ignorant that Fornication is a ſin. Whence it follows, that in ſuch a diſpoſition it may be committed innocently and without ſin: becauſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Principles of his Divinity and Society, that which is done by invincible ignorance is no ſin.</p>
                     <p>This permiſſion which he grants to commit Fornication by ignorance, is as it were, a preſumption and proof, that Fornication may be committed, according to him, by diſpenſation, ſince the one follows as well as the other from his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and is grounded upon the ſame foundation, which he eſtabliſheth or ſuppoſeth here in this place: That there is no evident Principle drawn from the light of Nature, by which it may be demonſtrated, that Fornication is evil in it ſelf, and forbidden by the Law of Nature.</p>
                     <p>And this ſame reaſon proves alſo, that he holds Fornication not to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Law of God. For no man can diſpenſe any more with the Law of God than with the Law of Nature. So that if Fornication were not forbidden by the Law of Nature, nevertheleſs it could not be diſpenſed with, if it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Law of God; and ſo whilſt he maintains, that if the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forbad it not, it might be lawful in ſome caſe by diſpenſation from men: he teſtifies clearly, that he believes not that it is forbidden by the Law of God.</p>

                        </note> The things, the knowledge whereof men ſo much eſteem, and which they take ſo much pleaſure to behold, or to entertain themſelves with, are, as he ſaith himſelf, Combats, Duels, Inchantments of Magicians, the Generation of Beaſts or men, and every thing that belongs to that action. So that, according to him, the thoughts of all theſe things, though a man entertain himſelf with them voluntarily and with pleaſure, and even for the pleaſures ſake which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes therein, will be no ſin. For he concludes all his Argumentation in theſe words:
<note n="3" place="margin">Ergo talis delectario non eſt de ſe mala.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>The only condition then which he demands, that we may entertain our ſelves innocently with the thoughts of theſe things, is that we ſtay not at the pleaſure alone which ariſes from theſe thoughts; and that we think not of what may come from the thing, or the wicked and diſhoneſt action we think on.</p>
                     <p>I will not ſtay to examine this imaginary condition in moral matters, any more than the Metaphyſical diſtinction and abſtraction whereupon it is grounded. I will only ſay, that to declare unto any perſon that he may take pleaſure in any filthy thought, provided that he reſpect not the filthy object that this thought repreſents unto him, or that he be not touched with the pleaſure which comes from it naturally; is as if one ſhould ſay, that one may ſtand before a fire, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he be not heated, and paſs through the dirt, provided he be not defiled.</p>

<note n="1" place="margin">Cômmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ſententia eſt in iſtis eſſe pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum mortife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, quae &amp; mihi probatur, tum quia com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munior, tum quia tutius eſt ut omnia iſta quam maxime vitentur; tum quia ſaepe peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum eſt ulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioris conſenſus vel moroſae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectationis, vel etiam pollutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, ratione temperamenti aut peculiaris diſpoſitionis corporis.

                        <hi>Firſt, becauſe this opinion is the more common. In the ſecond place, becauſe it is the ſafer courſe to remove our ſelves as far as we can from theſe things. In the third place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23910"/> becauſe there is oftentimes danger to conſent unto theſe things, and ſo to ſtay therein with pleaſure, or to fall into pollution, according to the complexion or diſpoſition of the body. For this cauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is expedient not to be too looſe in theſe things.</hi> Whence he infers, that theſe kiſſes muſt be abſolutely forbidden unto perſons betrothed.</p>
                     <p>But a little after he grants them as innocent and lawful things to the betrothed themſelves. For having made this Objection on the behalf of thoſe who are of the contrary opinion:
<note n="2" place="margin">Sponſis conceditur ea voluptas quae praeciſe ex oſculo &amp; contactu manus vel faclei percipitur; ita ut ne venialiter quidem in eo peccet. <hi>Ibid. num.</hi> 59.</note> 
                        <hi>It is allowed unto perſons betrothed to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they take in kiſſing, or touching the hands or faces of one another, ſo that herein they ſin not ſo much as venially.</hi> He anſwers, affirming this Propoſition,
<note n="3" place="margin">Sponſis conceditur, quia eſt ſignum copulae futurae, in quam ratione matrimonii conſentire quodammodo poſſunt. <hi>num.</hi> 59.</note> 
                        <hi>That it is allowed to betrothed perſons, becauſe this is a ſign of the carnal conjunction which is to be afterwards, whereunto they have in ſome ſort a right to conſent by reaſon of Marriage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He allows them the ſame kiſſes, which he had before condemned of mortal ſin, according to the more common Doctrine and his own opinion. And which is yet more ſtrange and extravagant, he hath allowed theſe unto them for the ſame reaſon for which he had ſaid above, that they could not be allowed them. <hi>This is granted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to perſons betrothed; becauſe it is a ſign of the future carnal conjunction, whereunto they have in ſome ſort a right to conſent by reaſon of Marriage.</hi> And a little above he had ſaid:

                        <hi>My advice is, that we ought wholly to divert from them, even perſons betrothed themſelves, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23920"/> becauſe theſe kiſſes as they produce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſure of themſelves, ſignifie naturally preſent or future carnal conjunction, as may be ſeen commonly amongſt Animals themſelves.

                     </p>
                     <p>I leave it to his Brethren to undo theſe contradictions. I will only obſerve here farther that he aſſures us, that betrothed perſons may take pleaſure, and conſent in ſome ſort to the action of Marriage, which they ſhall exerciſe when they are married; as if it were lawful to enjoy a right which we have not yet, and even which we ſhall never have; Marriage giving us only a power to do what is neceſſary for the begetting of children, and not to hunt after ſhameful pleaſures, and the ſatiating of luſt.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23940"/> I will only relate the words of the laſt who ſaith,
<note n="3" place="margin">Inchoatam in ſomno pollutionem non tenetur quis evigilans reprimere.</note> 
                        <hi>That a perſon who in his ſleep begins to fall into pollution, is not obliged to repreſs it when he awakes.</hi> This he takes for certain in his Divinity; and then demands, what is to be ſaid to it,
<note n="4" place="margin">Quid ſi gaudeat de llia pollutione, vel opter evenire? Si gaudear vel opter, non ob delectationem, ſed propter ſanitatem, vel ad ſedandas tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, nec peceatum quidem veniale eſt.</note> 
                        <hi>If he be well pleaſed with this pollution, and deſire it?</hi> His anſwer is,
<note n="5" place="margin">Quia quod licitum eſt deſiderare ut fiat, licitum eſt etiam eo gaudere quod factum fit, &amp; contra, ſi ſas gaudere de facto, etiam licitum erit deſiderare ut fiat.

<hi>Leſſius ſupra num.</hi> 105.</note> 
                        <hi>That if he be pleaſed with this pollution, and deſire it, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the pleaſure, but becauſe of his health, or to appeaſe temptations, it is not ſo much as a venial ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſſius</hi> gives the reaſon why the one and the other are lawful, to wit, to deſire pollution, and rejoyce in it. <hi>(6) Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when it is lawful to deſire a thing to come to paſs, it is alſo lawful to rejoyce in it when it doth come to paſs. For theſe things are of the ſame nature, according to the Rules of Morality; becauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light follows neceſſarily from the enjoyment of the good we deſire, and it preſuppoſes and contains in it the deſire of this good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſeems to ſet pollution in the rank of good things, ſince he finds the deſire thereof and delight taken therein to be good, ſaying,
<note n="7" place="margin">Nam gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium reſultat neceſſario ex bono denderato obtento.</note> 
                        <hi>That delight follows neceſſarily from the fruition of the good deſired.</hi> And indeed if pollution were not a good action, or at leaſt indifferent, his Argument were nothing worth. For as he ſaith, delight follows the nature of the thing wherein we delight. If therefore pollution be wicked and unlawful,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23950"/> according to him, the delight as well as deſire of it would be wicked, he could not ſay as he doth, that both are lawful.
<hi>Leſſius</hi> his opinion then is, that pollution is good and commendable, or indifferent at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>Upon which he expounds himſelf more clearly in the ſame place, building al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon this ſame reaſon, and ſaying for corroboration thereof,

<hi>Ibid.</hi>

                        <hi>That the material object of this joy is not wicked, and that its formal object is good.</hi> And he had ſaid a little above, that the reaſon why the deſire of pollution was lawful, is,

                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:46318:186"/>Whence he infers, not only that it is lawful to deſire the good effect which follows from pullution, as health, without deſiring the pollution it ſelf, as ſome teach, who are a little more reſerved than himſelf. But he concludes, that we may alſo deſire both at once, and be well pleaſed not of the relief only we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by means of the pollution it ſelf.
<note n="1" place="margin">Non ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum licitum eſt gaudere de ipſo effectu bono, ut quidam volunt, quamvis hic ſit formalis ratio objectiva, ſeu totum motivum deſiderli &amp; gaudil conſideratus cum conditione futuri vel praeſentis, ſed etiam de ipſa cauſa (pollutione ſc.) propter effectum.</note> 
                        <hi>It is not only lawful,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this good effect, according to ſome, though this joy have no other object or motive than this effect it ſelf, and regards it only as preſent or to come; but it is lawful to delight in the cauſe it ſelf, which is pollution, becauſe of the good effect it produces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſpeaks in all this diſcourſe of pollution as he might of eating and drinking, and all indifferent things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23960"/> For in the Morals we can give no other rank unto cating and drinking, which are natural actions, than that of indifferent things, which are not lawful to be deſired but becauſe of the need we have of them to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of our duties, and preſervation of our lives; and this Author would have it lawful to ſay all this of pollution; and he ſaith it in expreſs terms,
<note n="2" place="margin">Non eſt peccatum, non eſt malum, eſt per ſe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens; licet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am deſiderate, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet de ca gaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.
<hi>Ibid.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>That it is no evil, that it is no ſin; that of it ſelf it is an indifferent thing, that it is lawful to deſire it, that it is lawful to rejoyce in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that according to his Principles there is no more ill in pollution, than in eating and drinking; and as eating and drinking are a remedy againſt hunger and thirſt, pollution is, according to him, a remedy againſt indiſpoſition, heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of body and mind, and againſt temptation which puts the Soul in hazard of Salvation. And ſo as we make uſe of meat and drink to repair our ſtrength, and ſuſtain Nature; he holds, that we may alſo make uſe of pollution to recreate Nature, and to preſerve the health and repoſe of the mind as well as of the body.</p>
                     <p>Whence it follows from theſe very Principles of this Jeſuit and his Brethren, that as we may take and demand bread when we are hungry, we may likewiſe not only deſire, but alſo procure pollution when we feel our ſelves urged by temptation, or any corporal indiſpoſition which we hope by this means to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate.</p>
                     <p>This follows neceſſarily from his Principle. For it is allowable to do that which it is lawful to defire and receive with joy;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23970"/> it being ſo that deſire and joy cannot be ſetled but upon good things only, as <hi>Leſſius</hi> himſelf confeſſed formerly, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pollution it ſelf. And it is not only lawful to deſire the things which are good, and to rejoyce therein, but alſo to do them, to ſeek after, and procure them: So that if it be lawful to deſire pollution in it ſelf, and to rejoyce therein, it is alſo lawful to ſtir up and incline our ſelves to it as a good and blameleſs action.</p>
                     <p>So they are not aſhamed to declare, that we are not obliged to abſtain from things which cauſe pollution, though we know it by experience. And this is the formal deciſion which <hi>Eſcobar</hi> draws from the Principles of the Society.

                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon he alledges to excuſe him who falls thus into pollution after he had been drunk, is becauſe he had no intention to fall thereinto, although he have perceived that being drunk, he ſhould fall into it; <hi>

For this mans intention, without doubt, was not to make himſelf drunk, any more than to fall into pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only to take his pleaſure in eating and drinking, though he foreſaw that giving way thereto, he ſhould fall into drunkenneſs, and conſequently into pollution.</p>
                     <p>We may even affirm truly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23990"/> that his intent was farther from drunkenneſs than pollution; becauſe drunkenneſs bringing nothing but hurt and inconvenience to the body and mind, is not a thing deſirable in it ſelf; and pollution on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſince it may have good effects, as the allaying of the inconveniencies of the body, or troubles of the mind, may, by this Jeſuits Argument, be abſolutely deſired. And by conſequence, if when a man falls into pollution after he hath been drunk, pollution be no mortal ſin, becauſe he had no intention to fall into it; drunkenneſs will yet be leſs ſuch, becauſe he had leſs intention to be drunk.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuits ſay then, 1. That it is lawful to deſire pollution in it ſelf. 2. That it is lawful to rejoyce in it when it is come on us. 3. That it is lawful to do that which excites it, as to uſe hot meats, to be tranſported to exceſs in eating and drinking, ſo far as to be drunk, though we foreſee, and know by e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the conſequent thereof will be, that we ſhall fall into pollution. It muſt needs be that they believe, that we may abſolutely procure it. For this is indeed to procure a thing, to purſue it with inclination, and after we have done what we know is neceſſary to procure and produce it, to rejoyce and be well pleaſed when it is come.</p>
                     <p>This Doctrine is very convenient to bring to paſs the deſigns of the Devil of Uncleanneſs, who after he hath tempted men by day with diſhoneſt thoughts, continues to torment them alſo in the night by illuſions. Which the Church hath judged ſo important a thing, and ſo much to be feared and avoided by its Children, that in its Publick Prayers it hath inſtituted one for demanding pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly of God, that he would preſerve them from theſe nocturnal illuſions, and eſpecially from pollution.</p>

                     <p>But if the Church teach us in this manner to avoid, and by our prayers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent pollutions which might happen in the night againſt our wills, and without our giving occaſion unto them; with what ſeverity would it not have condemned them to whom they happen night and day, after they have deſired and procured them, by doing what they foreſaw muſt needs bring them on?</p>
                     <p>Beyond the things I have formerly related concerning this ſubject in the Chapter of Luſt, and thoſe which I ſhall relate alſo, treating particularly of the Duties of married Perſons, I could report here alſo abundance of other moſt filthy and ſhameful opinions, if Chriſtian modeſty did not oblige me to uſe great moderation in a diſcourſe which neceſſity only allows me to make uſe of, and honeſty obliges me to cut as ſhort as poſſibly I can, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24010"/> ſpeaking of a matter wherein the things themſelves that are lawful and honeſt, can hardly be honeſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.

                     <p>It ſuffices to ſee by theſe diſcourſes of the Jeſuits which I have cited, the great licence their Divinity gives to the luſt of the fleſh, of abandoning our ſelves to filthy and diſhoneſt thoughts, ſo as to rejoyce in the imaginations of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all ſorts of perſons, provided we imagine that we have married them, or that we deſire to marry them; and that pollutions and other ſhameful effects which may ariſe from theſe thoughts, are not ſins, or but ſlight ones. There are many vicious and immodeſt people who would content themſelves with this, to ſatisfie their infamous paſſions. Alſo from theſe its eaſie to paſs to other exceſſes, and wholly to let the reins looſe to all ſenſual motions and deſires.</p>

And indeed there are abundance of things whereof the owners make no uſe, and it may be never will, which by this Principle it will be lawful to take away without ſcruple, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24030"/> and without fear of being obliged unto reſtitution.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bauny</hi> handling the ſame Queſtion ſaith, that it is the common opinion amongſt Divines, that he who hath at divers times ſtoln many ſmall ſums, loſes Gods grace when he attains to a ſum ſufficient to conſtitute a mortal ſin. And then he adds by way of correction to theſe Authors; <hi>Nevertheleſs by their permiſſion I dare ſay,</hi> 1. <hi>That the laſt theft which is ſuppoſed to be a ſmall one, even as thoſe which went before, is only venial.</hi> And a little after intermingling his own diſcourſe with <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi>'s, and ſpeaking part Latine, part French, as if he feared to be underſtood of all people, he draws this Concluſion from this Authors Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: <hi>Sa verbo furtum, num.</hi> 8. ſaith he, <hi>relying on this foundation that he, qui per vices pauca alicui furatus eſt, cum ad notabilem quantitatem pervenerit, is not obliged under pain of eternal damnation to reſtore any of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which above all things in the world toucheth men moſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24050"/> and hinders them moſt from doing wrong to their neighbour, is an apprehenſion of being obliged to reſtore; but this is to give them all kind of liberty to ſteal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all ſorts of injuries, to take from them this fear, diſpenſing with them for reſtitution and for all puniſhment not only of this life, but alſo of the other, and eternal damnation, as doth this Jeſuit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the reaſon is a ſtrong one,</hi> ſaith he.
<hi>For to repair the wrong whereof we have happened to be the cauſe, none is obliged under pain of eternal damnation, when in doing it, we have only ſinned venially; becauſe ſuch an obligation is not the effect of other than mortal ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that according to <hi>Bauny,</hi> a man may feather his own neſt, and even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich himſelf with the goods of another, provided he take not too much at once, and proceed thereto only by ſmall Thefts, which yet all together at length make up a notable ſum, without obliging the Thief to any reſtitution <hi>on the pain of undergoing eternal damnation.</hi> So reſtitution and damnation belong only to <pb n="342" facs="tcp:46318:188"/>Thieves that are not crafty enough, or covetous over-much. There are Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Bankers, Confederates, and other Traders, who may heap up extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary riches by this method, by taking in many parcels ſmall ſums which together produce very great ones, and they need not ceaſe for all that to live in repoſe, without fear of damnation or reſtitution, which is to them many times more ſevere and afflicting, if they will relye upon <hi>Bauny</hi>'s word and the Divinity of his Society.</p>
                     <p>This ſame Caſuiſt ſpeaking of things that are found,

                        <hi>according to the opinion of ſome, we may without any ſin appropriate them unto our ſelves with the following circumſtances. The firſt is, that we inform our ſelves of the neighbourhood, or of thoſe who by their condition may beſt know news thereof, if they have no knowledge of the true and lawful poſſeſſor. The ſecond is, that we be in a diſpoſition readily to reſtore it when the true owner ſhall make appear it is his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though this opinion be falſe and very unjuſt, yet he ſeems to make it leſs cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal by the qualification he gives it, being not willing that he who keeps the things he finds, ſhould appropriate them unto himſelf, and permitting him only to become depoſitory, and to make uſe of them, ſo only that he be <hi>diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them</hi> to the demandant, <hi>when he makes appear they are his.</hi> But he immediately after deſtroys this condition, by eſtabliſhing three Principles which he holds for certain, and whereupon he will have the deciſion of this difficulty entirely to depend.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, <hi>that he who hath theſe things, may appropriate them to himſelf, if he be poor.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>that this being once done,</hi> that is to ſay, the thing found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once thus appropriated, <hi>it ſhall ſo properly belong unto him, that though the true owner appear afterwards, he ſhall not be obliged to quit the poſſeſſion thereof.</hi> Which doth wholly deſtroy what he had before eſtabliſhed as a neceſſary condition unto the power of retaining what is found; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24070"/>
                        <hi>that he ſhould be diſpoſed to reſtore it to him who ſhould demand it, when it appeared that it was his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Principle, <hi>That under the name of the poor are compriſed the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Hoſpitals, Churches, thoſe that want things neceſſary for a moderate mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as well of their quality as of their life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If he be a poor man that hath not all that which is neceſſary to ſupport himcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditably according to his condition, there is ſcarce any man at this day who may not call himſelf poor, and who by conſequence may not appropriate to himſelf all the loſt things he can find, or which ſhall be directed to him, without being ever obliged to reſtore them, though they whoſe they are come to challenge them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Layman</hi> is of the ſame opinion. For after he had ſaid, that in the caſe of things found, the common opinion of the Doctors is, that they ought abſolutely be reſtored to them whoſe they are, or at leaſt if he be not found to be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the poor, and employed in good works; he ſupports this opinion alſo on the Authority of S.
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> bringing a paſſage out of this great Doctor of the Church, which he took out of the 9. of his 50 Homilies.

                     <p>And on the other hand he relates alſo the contrary opinion which holds, that we may appropriate and keep things found. And afterwards paſſing ſentence upon this difference, he concludes in theſe terms.

<hi>That a wife or children being called unto Judgment to ſee themſelves condemned, to confeſs what they have put aſide, taken out from, or uſurped of the Moveables, Inheritance, or Goods of the Deceaſed, are not in conſcience obliged to confeſs it.</hi> And becauſe they may be brought upon their Oaths, and obliged to ſwear before a Judge, he gives them this expedient: <hi>Nevertheleſs that they may not lye, and ſo doing foreſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the prudent Confeſſor ſhall teach them that they are to frame a conception in their minds, according to which they may form their anſwer and oath, which they may make by the command of the Judge, to juſtifie, and make him believe their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in caſe they meet not with a prudent Confeſſor who underſtands well theſe ſhifts and deceits, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24100"/> and fall into the hands of one who ſeems to them too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and would oblige them to reſtore what they have privily taken away, he holds that they are excuſed from giving credit unto him; and though the Church it ſelf ſhould interpoſe and employ its Authority, and preſs them by vertue of a Monitory to come unto Confeſſion and Reſtitution, they would not be obliged to obey it: <hi>Becauſe in this occurrent,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>neither the wife nor the children aforeſaid ought, or can be forced by the Confeſſor to reveal the things they ſo purloyn'd, though the Creditors ſhould obtain Mandates and Letters monitory from the Biſhop.</hi>

                     <p>From the ſame Principle he affirms in the ſame Chapter, pag. 200. <hi>That a perſon, who is indebted for very great and notable ſums, may, to the prejudice of his Creditors,</hi> give away part of his goods, ſo that he to whom the gift is made, ſhall not be obliged to reſtore any part thereof to his Creditors, if he be not conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law. See how he concludes after he had propoſed contrary opinions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point: <hi>I ſay then, that he who hath received by Deed of Gift any moveable
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46318:189"/>or immoveable of a man in great debt, is not obliged to quit it in favour of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of ſuch a Debtor, before the Law conſtrain him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the following Page he propounds another Caſe upon the ſame Subject; and he reſolves it after ſuch a manner as authorizes and maintains, not only injury, but revenge alſo and murder. <hi>Some one,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>entreats a Souldier to ſmite and beat his neighbour, or to burn the Farm of a man who hath offended him. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether the Souldier failing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24110"/> the other who prayed him to do all theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, ought to repair out of his own Eſtate the damage which proceeded thence?</hi> Upon which he makes a Relation of ſome Authors who hold the affirmative, and without quoting any one for the contrary opinion, he broaches it as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaith for refuting the firſt: <hi>My opinion is not as theirs. For no man is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to reſtore, if he have not violated Juſtice. Doth he ſo who ſubmits himſelf to anothers pleaſure, when he only entreats of him a favour?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This goodly reaſoning may ſerve to juſtifie from doing wrong, not only all men who employ their friends or other perſons to do miſchief, making uſe of them as their hands and inſtruments, and ſo doing the very ſame action and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury with them, whether they commit theft or murder, or other violences: but it may alſo juſtifie all perſons who induce and ſollicite others unto wickedneſs, and the Devil himſelf when he tempts men, and cauſes them to ſin; becauſe temptation and ſollicitations unto evil force not the will, and are only induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and prayers as it were which depend abſolutely on them who are tempted and ſollicited to do evil, which many do alſo refuſe and reject.</p>
                     <p>Behold whereunto the Maxims of this Caſuiſt are reduced. They teach to ſteal with ſubtilty and confidence, without being obliged unto reſtitution; to ſpeak againſt ones conſcience, without lying; to forſwear, without treachery; to make a mock of Juſtice, without being deficient in the reſpect due thereto; to contemn the Authority of the Church, without diſobedience; and finally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud Creditors, ruine Commerce, deſtroy publick Faith, and make havock of our neighbours goods, without injuſtice.</p>

                        <hi>That the opinion which holds that a perſon who hath born falſe witneſs through ignorance or inadvertence, without ſinning mortally, is obliged to nothing, though this falſe teſtimony do occaſion the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man, is ſafe in practice, though the opinion ſeem to him more agreeable unto reaſon.</hi> For he regards no more to follow the light of natural reaſon and equity, than the Rules of Faith; but only his own ſenſe and the Authority of ſuch as he is, in reſolving difficulties which refer to Manners and Religion. And this is one of the moſt goodly and commodious Principles of the Jeſuits Divinity, that we are not obliged to reſtitution when we have not ſinned mortally in wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our neighbour. For if this Principle <hi>be ſure,</hi> they who find a great ſum of money, or take it by ignorance and heedleſneſs, are not obliged to reſtore it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not ſinned mortally in taking of it.

                     <p>He holds then indeed, though he dare not declare it, that it is alſo probable, that one may without any ſin, as well as in juſtice, commit all ſorts of crimes to hide one he hath committed, and to oppreſs by ſlanders, falſe Witneſſes, forged Writings, corruption of Courts, and publick Perſons, him who would diſcover it; becauſe he is perſwaded he accuſes him unjuſtly, that is to ſay, he cannot prove what he ſaith by the ways and formalities commonly uſed in Courts of Juſtice, though it be true and certain.</p>

                        <p>THis Commandment carries with it two obligations. One not to labour on Feſtival and Lords days; the other is to keep them holy. This is the end of the Precept, the other is but a mean to accompliſh it. For that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us principally on theſe Holy-days, is that we employ our ſelves pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly to ſanctifie him, or rather to ſanctifie our ſelves in ſerving him: And that we may be at more leiſure, and attend better and with greater devotion and liberty unto his Service, he wills, and the Church hath on its behalf commanded us on theſe days to quit the care of all other affairs, and abſtain from all employments which might hinder or divert us from it.</p>
                        <p>The Jeſuits acknowledge theſe two obligations contained in this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but they deſtroy them at the ſame time by falſe explications and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations altogether humane, as we ſhall now preſently ſee in this Article, which we ſhall divide expreſly into two Points, and each of them ſhall have two Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, that we may more diſtinctly and clearly repreſent the Opinions of the Jeſuits upon each of theſe obligations.</p>

                           <p>He teſtifies that to dance, play, go to a Stage-play, are not actions forbidden by this Commandment, becauſe theſe are not actions proper unto ſervants nor ſlaves. And he diſcovers his opinion ſufficiently by what he ſpeaks in the ſequel:

                           </p>
                           <p>This ſuffices him not, to have reduced the Churches Prohibition of working on Feaſt-days to thoſe works only which are proper for ſlaves and ſervants, as if this part of the Commandment were only for ſervants; he thought fit alſo to put a great exception to it by ſaying;
<hi>Praeterquam ſi jure vel conſuetudine permiſſa ſint.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From this exception, as a Principle, he draws many Concluſions, which are ſo many uſurpations upon this Commandment,

                           <p>He adds a little after, that to follow theſe exerciſes, that is to ſay, to write and paint on the Feaſt-days, not only for divertiſement, or ſome juſt and neceſſary cauſe, but alſo out of a meer mercenary Spirit, and for lucre only, is no evil; and his reaſon is:

                           <p>And this Jeſuit himſelf acknowledges it ſufficiently in affirming that theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Hunting, and War, &amp;c. are of a ſervile nature, and forbidden by the civil Law on the Feaſt-days.

                           </p>
                           <p>That is to ſay, that a ſervant may not go on hunting in obedience to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when he ſends him; but the Maſter may go for his pleaſure, and the ſervant alſo; and by conſequence, that obedience in labour profanes a Holy day, but pleaſure in the ſame work profanes it not.</p>
                           <p>Speaking in the ſame place of thoſe who labour in cleanſing, hanging, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24270"/> and trimming Churches on Feaſt-days, he ſaith that they ſin at the leaſt venially, if they have not ſome lawful cauſe. He ſaith the ſame thing of the outward works of mercy which are exerciſed towards our neighbour, as to mend the cloaths of the poor, to carry them wood, or other things whereof they have need; theſe actions, according to him, are ſervile and forbidden on Feaſt-days.</p>
                           <p>He would have it lawful to paint and hunt for pleaſure on Feaſt-days; and he will not have it lawful to ſweep, hang, and adorn the Church for the Service of God.

                              <hi>It ſeems that to ſweep Churches, to hang them, and other ſuch like actions, are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24290"/> and to do them without lawful excuſe, is at leaſt a venial ſin, though not mortal, if not done through contempt.</hi> Strange Divinity, that we need not to fear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the Command of God, forbidding us to work on the Feaſt and Lords-days, by working for our ſelves; becauſe we take our pleaſure in the work, as in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that we ought to fear contempt and mortal ſin in working only for the Service of God and the Church!</p>
                           <p>So that theſe days which God hath ordained particularly for his Service may be employed, according to this Divinity, to ſerve any thing but him.

<hi>Eſcobar</hi> would have ſaid that it was not lawful to do good. <hi>Non licet bene facere:</hi> ſince he maintains that it is not lawful to dreſs Churches, nor carry alms to the poor: and <hi>Filliutius</hi> might have ſaid that it is lawful to do evil, <hi>licet male facere,</hi> ſince he believes that ſins do not profane theſe days: <hi>Opera peccaminoſa non eſſe ſpecialiter prohibita die Feſto, quaſi per illa dies Feſtus violetur.</hi>

                              <hi>The principal reaſon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is becauſe this third Commandment, being divine as it is, obliges not particularly not to ſin on the Feaſt days.</hi> As if to command us only to honour and ſerve him, and eſpecially on this day, were not particularly to forbid us to offend God thereon, there being nothing more oppoſite to honouring God than ſinning againſt him.</p>
                           <p>He alledges a ſecond reaſon yet more ſtrange;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24310"/> ſaying, <hi>That to ſin, as to ſlander, forſwear, commit fornication, and ſuch like, are not ſervile actions.</hi> And becauſe S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> after the holy Fathers and the Scripture, hath ſaid that there is no baſer ſervitude, nor more oppoſite to the Sanctification of Feaſt-days, than that of fin, which makes us ſlaves of the Devil, and cauſeth us to give that ſervice unto him which we owe particularly unto God on theſe days, he prevents this reaſon, and touches it only in his way, as not making any great account of it. <hi>It is of no importance,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to ſay, that he who ſinneth becomes the ſlave of ſin; becauſe this is not true, but in Metaphor and figure, and not indeed and really, as</hi> Suarez <hi>hath ſhewn at large.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He ſpeaks this generally without excepting any perſon, when he ſaith, that this word: He who ſinneth becometh the ſlave of ſin, is not really true, though he could not be ignorant that it is Jeſus Chriſt his ſpeech in the 8 of S. <hi>John,</hi>
                              <pb n="352" facs="tcp:46318:193"/>where he ſaith, <hi>That every man who ſinneth, is the ſlave of ſin: omnis qui facit peccatum, ſervus eſt peccati.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is an imagination very novel amongſt Chriſtians, that an indifferent action, or rather good in it ſelf and laudible, as it is to adorn the Church, ſhould be more baſe and more ſervile, and therefore more forbidden on Feaſt-days, and more contrary to the Holineſs which God demands of us on theſe days, than the moſt enormous ſins. But this is a novelty and an exceſs yet more ſtrange,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24320"/> to ſay that theſe ſins are not properly ſervile actions; that is to ſay, that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the natural liberty and honour of men, and above all of Chriſtians.</p>
                           <p>Whence it will follow, as in effect this Jeſuit fears not to affirm, that Jeſus Chriſt ſpoke not properly, when he ſaid, that he who ſinneth, is the ſlave of ſin; nor S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith, that ſinners are ſlaves of the Devil, and that he holds them Captives.</p>
                           <p>And he muſt hereupon declare that Jeſus Chriſt hath not properly delivered, nor redeemed us, ſince they cannot be properly delivered who are not properly ſlaves; and they are not properly redeemed who are properly in ſlavery and captivity. And finally in the height of impiety, he muſt take away from Jeſus Chriſt the quality of a Redeemer and a Saviour, and ſay that he is but a Metaphorick and Symbolick Redeemer and Saviour, and not a proper and true one, but an improper and figurative one, contrary to the word of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.

                              <hi>Becauſe, to ſpeak properly, it is no fraud for a man to make uſe of his right, and that it is rather to avoid the obligation of the Precept, which being it is not forbidden by the Precept it ſelf, it follows that it is a thing in it ſelf indifferent.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is a ſtrange right, this of not obſerving Feſtivals, and to play in this manner with the Church, by eluding its Commandment. If all the Inhabitants would make uſe of this pretended right, and betake themſelves every one to his own affairs, to his work, or would only walk abroad for their divertiſement out of the Pariſh where the Feaſt is, there would be no Feaſt, or indeed the Rector muſt celebrate it all alone, or with his Prieſts only, if he have any.</p>
                           <p>But this Authors reaſon is pleaſant, that to depart expreſly out of the Pariſh where the Feaſt is, to labour in another where there is no Feaſt, is not to deceive, but only to avoid the Precept of the Church. As if to avoid payment of what we owe, were not to deceive, and a child ought not to be taken for diſobedient and rebellious who flyes away, that he may not do what his father commands him.</p>
                           <p>And that which he adds to confirm this reaſon, is alſo very conſiderable: That the Church not forbidding to depart out of the Pariſh where the Feaſt is, it is a thing indifferent and free to every one;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24360"/> and by conſequence there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon any one to ſtay and keep Feaſts.</p>
                           <p>By the Judgment of this Jeſuit the Manuals of the Church muſt be reformed, and when the Rector doth thenceforth recommend a Feaſt to his Pariſhioners, it will not be ſufficient to ſay, that they are obliged to obſerve it, he muſt alſo forbid them on the Churches behalf from going out of the Pariſh to diſcharge themſelves of their obligation. The Commandment of the Church muſt likewiſe be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and not ſay only, as it hath done hitherto, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſanctifie the Feaſts,</hi> but add alſo; Thou ſhalt not flye out of the Pariſh where they are kept, to diſcharge thy ſelf of the obligation of keeping them holy: becauſe without this be done, all the Pariſhioners may abandon the Church, according to this new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and leave the Rector to officiate alone.</p>
                           <p>Another Expedient <hi>Eſcobar</hi> gives us to defeat this Command, is to keep infidel Servants and Workmen, who may be employed and made to work on Feaſt-days. That he might eſtabliſh this Maxime, he demands:

                           <p>A fool indeed ſins not, no more than a Horſe when he works on Feaſt-days; but he that makes the one and the other work, ſhall bear the ſin, becauſe he is the Author of the work, and it is he properly that works, as it is the Plow-man that turns up the land, rather than the Plow and the Oxen which he uſes thereunto: And it ſeems that they ought to renounce reaſon, who have renounced the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience they owe unto God and the Church, that they may imagine that they offend not in cauſing that to be done in their houſes, for their own intereſt alone, which is forbidden, and which they dare not do themſelves.</p>

                           <p>To give authority to his imagination,

                           <p>He makes great account, and lays a great ſtreſs upon this paſſage, and he would have it obſerved as very important in this matter, believing he had therein found all he ſought for. <hi>See,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how he forbids us on the holy Lords-days to employ our ſelves in manual operations?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I will not inſiſt on it, that this learned Divine quotes a Sermon as S. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> which notwithſtanding is not his. But I cannot but admire the ſimplicity of this good man, who brings for proof of his Propoſition a paſſage which deſtroys it, and which proves evidently the quite contrary to what he pretends. For the Author of this Sermon ſpeaking of that part of the Commandment which forbids to work on Feſtival and Lords-days, requires us on theſe days not only to cut off all buſineſſes and cares about all earthly things; but worldly pleaſures and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements alſo; <hi>

And on the contrary this Jeſuit and his Brethren allow a multitude of perſons to work, and leave an entire liberty to the whole world, to delight themſelves with what pleaſures and divertiſements they pleaſe: even with thoſe which are forbidden by Gods Laws, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24390"/> without herein doing any thing contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Church or Sanctification of the Feaſts: <hi>provided only they take the pains to hear Maſs,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Bauny.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And for the other part of the Commandment which concerns the Sanctification of the Feaſt-days, he makes his blindneſs to appear much more clearly in what he relates out of the ſame Author and the Councils who evidently condemn his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the very places he alledges, as we ſhall preſently ſee in the ſecond Part of this Chapter.</p>

                           <p>If he would draw any advantage from this paſſage, he ought at leaſt to have cut off theſe laſt words; <hi>neque in venatione ſe occupet.</hi> For citing them as out of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> who relates the Commandment of the Apoſtles, he acknowledgeth that according to S.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> and the Apoſtles, hunting is forbidden on the Lords-day, which nevertheleſs, according to the opinion of this Father and his Brethren, is lawful on this day for thoſe perſons who employ themſelves therein only for recreation.</p>
                           <p>He ought alſo have taken notice, that this place makes nothing at all for him, and in no wiſe proves what he pretends. For this Author whom he cites, ſaith indeed that no perſon ought to diſpenſe with himſelf for hearing Maſs on the Lord-day; but he ſaith not that this will ſuffice him to acquit himſelf as he ought of this Precept which commands him to ſanctifie this day.

                           <p>After <hi>Bauny</hi> had ſo well expounded this paſſage, and had made ſo happy uſe of it unto his deſign, he joyns the Authority of the Councils to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and S.

                           <p>As if the Church approved all things it tolerates, or which comes not to its knowledge.

And becauſe the Paſtors of the Church diſſemble them ſometimes, and ſuffer them with ſorrow and groaning, feeing at preſent neither means nor diſpoſition to correct or repreſs them, it is to do them great wrong, and to abuſe unjuſtly their patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to draw from thence advantage to deceive the world, and to make the Commonalty and ſimple people believe that the Biſhops approve by their ſilence all that they condemn not openly, though they frequently lament it before God: See here how errours and abuſes ſlide into the Church, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24480"/> and eſtabliſh themſelves therein by little and little; they that have introduced them pretending at laſt to make them paſs for Laws and Rules of the Church.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bauny</hi> in his Sum, cap. 27. pag. 181. propoſes alſo this queſtion: <hi>Whether it be ſatisfactory to the Precept of hearing Maſs, to hear one part of it of one Prieſt, and another of a ſecond different from the firſt?</hi> He quotes <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> and others who hold the affirmative, and approving this opinion, he adds: <hi>I hold it for true, for that hearing it in that manner, that is done which the Church would have. For it is true to ſay that he who hears of one Prieſt ſaying the Maſs after he is entred into the Church, that which follows the Conſecration unto the end, and of a ſecond who ſucceeds the firſt, that which goes before the Conſecration, hath heard all the Maſs, ſince he hath been found preſent indeed at all its parts.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He ſtays not here. He ſaith moreover, that we may not only hear the Maſs in this manner in parts at twice, when two Prieſts ſay it in courſe and ſucceſſively without interruption; but alſo at thrice or four times, and more with interruption and at as great a diſtance of time as we will. And becauſe he ſaw that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion might be ill received becauſe of its novelty, he would make it paſſable under the name of <hi>Azor,</hi> that we might not believe that he invented it himſelf.
<hi>It is demanded,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if this ought to be done in an uninterrupted ſucceſſion, and without intermiſſion of time?</hi> Azor p. 1. lib. 7. cap. 3. q. 3. <hi>anſwers no, and that dividing it, we may at divers times attend unto ſo many parts of the Maſs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24490"/> as may make up one entire Maſs.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That is to ſay, that we may hear it of ſo many different Prieſts as there are parts in the Maſs, provided that what we have heard of every one apart being <pb n="359" facs="tcp:46318:196"/>joyned together, contain all that is ſaid in a Maſs; and though the Prieſts ſay theſe Maſſes at far diſtant times and Altars, we fail not by hearing them in this manner, to ſatisfie the Commandment of the Church, and to have truly heard an entire Maſs compoſed of parts ſo different and incoherent. It were better to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Commandment of the Church openly, than to make ſport with it in ſo ridiculous a manner, and with ſo ſtrange a liberty, which can be good for nothing but to make the Maſs and all Religion contemptible to Hereticks and Atheiſts.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time this goodly reaſon which ſuffices to fulfil the Precept of the Church, by attending at all parts of the Maſs in what manner ſoever we hear them, whether it be in a continued ſucceſſion, and at once, or by many parts, and at divers times, hath brought things to ſuch a paſs, that ſome exceed ſo far as to ſay, that entring into a Church where we find two Prieſts at two Altars, whereof the one hath newly begun his Maſs, and the other is at the middle of his, if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at once to the one from the beginning unto the middle, and to the other from the middle unto the end, we ſhall thereby diſcharge our duty of hearing Maſs. <hi>Bauny</hi> cites for this opinion <hi>Azor</hi> and ſome others, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24500"/> and <hi>Azor</hi> ſpeaks in theſe terms:
<hi>If that be true which the ſecond opinion affirms, I ſee nothing to hinder but he may fulfil the Precept, who entring into a Church hears the Maſs in two parts of two ſeveral Prieſts who ſay it at the ſame time. For as for attention he may lend it to them both at once. For this cauſe I approve this opinion, not becauſe it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a ſufficiently forcible reaſon; but becauſe it is ſupported by the Authority of conſiderable perſons.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He acknowledges that this opinion is ridiculous in it ſelf, and contrary to the Commandments of the Church, and the reſpect which is due unto the Maſs, and is alſo without reaſon and ſolid foundation; and for all that he forbears not to approve it, for fear of diſobliging and reproaching thoſe who maintain it, to whoſe Authority he chuſes rather to ſubmit his Judgment, than to that of the Church and Reaſon.</p>

This Saint ſaith, that a man who goes to Church only to look on Women, and to entertain himſelf with filthy thoughts in beholding them, ſo that without this he would not go to Church, nor hear Maſs on a Feaſt-day, doth not fulfil the Precept, if he be there with ſuch inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But <hi>Azor</hi> rejects this opinion, eluding it by a very ſubtle diſtinction.

Whereas the homage we owe unto God in this eſtate, is only apparent and altogether outward, and conſiſts in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the preſence and poſture of the body.

                           </p>
                           <p>He hath reaſon to ſay, as it is uſually done; becauſe it happens hardly at all to be done otherwiſe amongſt the moſt indevout themſelves. Since though the reſpect for theſe Myſteries could not induce them unto this interruption, yet the diverſity of the actions and Ceremonies of the Maſs would conſtrain thereunto all thoſe who would not appear openly profane. Private diſcourſes muſt needs be interrupted, that we may kneel when the Prieſt deſcends to the foot of the Altar at the beginning of the Maſs, when we ſtand up at the reading of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when we kneel after the Goſpel, or at leaſt before the Conſecration; there is no perſon ſo irreligious as not to be ſilent, and ſhew reſpect at leaſt outwardly when the Prieſt elevates the Hoſt to adore and cauſe it to be adored by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; as alſo when he communicates, and when he gives the Communion. So that when <hi>Filliutius</hi> ſaith, that talking and diſcourſe of affairs are lawful during the Maſs, and are not contrary to the Commandment of the Church, provided they be interrupted and mingled with ſome attention, he declares openly enough that they be all allowed, there ſcarcely ever being other than of this ſort.
<hi>Bauny</hi> is of the ſame opinion, and he expounds it alſo more clearly in his Sum, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24580"/> Chap. 17. pag. 278. in theſe terms: <hi>Men and women who during the Sacrifice of the Maſs interrupt your prayers by unneceſſary diſcourſes, though often repeated, fulfil the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi> And he adds a little after, <hi>That to be ſlightly diſtracted in prayer, is of it ſelf a ſlight fault.</hi> Whence he infers: <hi>That albeit it be reiterated and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied during the Maſs, it can never proceed to be mortal.</hi> And from this diſcourſe he concludes abſolutely. <hi>Therefore to ſpeak a few words to our neighbour, after returning to prayer, and from thence to talk again, is not a thing which in rigour can hinder our attention to the Maſs.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But if nevertheleſs any perſon would chat continually during the Maſs, theſe Doctors would not condemn him to hear another, provided theſe diſcourſes were not about ſerious matters, but ſlight, and which did not too much employ the mind.

                           <p>This is a Paradox greater than thoſe of the Stoicks, that we may obey by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, honour by diſhonouring, and diſcharge our duty to God and the Church by ſins and crimes contrary to the Ordinances of God and the Church. And there remains nothing more for theſe Doctors to ſay, but that crimes and ſins are good actions, ſince they may ſerve, according to them, to the accompliſhment of the Commandments of God and the Church: ſince God and the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command other than good actions.</p>
                           <p>And this is that which <hi>Celot</hi> ſeems to pretend, when he tmaintains, that he who hears the Maſs out of vain-glory, doth a good work. This is in his 9. Book and 7. Chapter, where he encounters with <hi>Peter Seguenot,</hi> and reproves him for having ſaid, that though we cannot accompliſh as we ought the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God and the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24610"/> without the aſſiſtance of Grace; yet we may by the force of Nature only, and without Grace do all the outward actions that are commanded. And to oppoſe himſelf unto him more directly, he ſpeaks in theſe terms:

                              <hi>I maintain on the contrary, that a man who is in an eſtate of mortal ſin, going to Church and Maſs on a Feaſt-day, which is the Commandment, for fear of loſing his reputation, though his work be imperfect, ceaſes not to act by Grace, preventing and accompanying him, and that he offends not againſt the obedience he owes to the Church.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This action is out of vain-glory, and notwithſtanding it muſt be good and holy if it be done by the motion of preventing and accompanying Grace, as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; or indeed he muſt ſay that a ſin muſt proceed of Grace as of its Principle, and that Grace may cauſe us to ſin; which were Blaſphemy, or rather a folly greater than theirs who have ſaid that God is the Author of ſin. For they have not ſaid that he cauſes us to ſin in giving us Grace, but rather in refuſing to give it, and puſhing us on unto ſin, not by his Grace but by his Power.</p>

                        <p>FAſting in the Church conſiſts in abſtinence from certain victuals which it hath forbidden, and to be content with one meal a day, which ſometimes is not taken till in the evening after Even-ſong, or at leaſt after Noon in certain leſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Faſt-days, as in the Vigils of Feſtivals; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24630"/> which was practiſed alſo in the days of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and long after, as the Caſuiſts themſelves agree. In our days they have anticipated the time of repaſt, changing ſupper into dinner, and they have of late introduced the cuſtom of making Collations at night.</p>
                        <p>There is none who ſees not that this change hath brought great relaxation in Faſting, according to what was obſerved and inſtituted by all Antiquity; and it is not without great condeſcenſion that the Church ſuffers that it ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by ſuch an obſervation.</p>
                        <p>The Jeſuits in the mean time find it to ſevere; and to ſweeten and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date it to the world, they have reduced it to ſuch a point, that to faſt, according to their Maxims, is in truth not to faſt at all, and to make good chear.</p>
                        <p>To make this more clearly appear, we will divide this Article into three Points. In the firſt we ſhall ſee how they regulate eating and the hour of repaſt on Faſting-days.

                        <p>According to this ſolid Divinity, they all in a manner conclude, that drink breaks not the Faſt at what time and in what exceſs ſoever it be taken. At this time (ſaith <hi>Bauny</hi> in his Sum, ſpeaking of the Collation at night, Chap. 16. pag. 255.) drinking concerns not the Faſt, as neither on the day. Which very well agrees with the Inſtitution of the Faſt, and as this Jeſuit ſpeaks himſelf, pag. 258.

                        <p>The ſame Author ſaith in the ſame place, pag. 256, that ſo often as we eat fleſh and eggs on a Faſting-day, ſo many ſins we commit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24690"/>
                           <hi>That it is not ſo in other victuals, as bread, fiſh, and butter, the uſe whereof repeated ſo often as our appetite requires them, after the ſecond time is no ſin.</hi> His reaſon is,
<hi>Becauſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that what exceeds above neceſſary, turns into crudities in the ſtomach, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe not but weaken ſtrength, it ſeems that it cannot reaſonably be ſaid that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt which is taken above the ſecond, profits the body, much leſs that it ſtrengthens it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He would ſay that exceſſive eating and drinking do the ſame thing that Faſting, which is to enfeeble the body; and conſequently that exceſſes which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Lent</hi> by eating as much and as oft as their appetite requires it, after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, are not ſins againſt the Faſt, becauſe they are not againſt the intention and end for which it was inſtituted.</p>
                        <p>This Father hath not conſidered the difference betwixt mortifying and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the body; betwixt the abating the violence of ſenſuality, and enervating the forces of Nature. The intention of the Church and the end of Faſting is to abate the violence of ſenſuality, and not to deprive the body of its ſtrength. It pretends on the contrary to cure by abſtinence the weakneſſes and infirmities of the body as well as of the Soul, as it alſo declares frequently in the office and in the prayers of the <hi>Lent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This good Elder took no heed of this diſtinction. He confounds ſenſuality which is in the body as a ſtrange heat equal to that of a Fever, and which gives no ſtrength to it but to rebel againſt the Spirit and againſt the Law of God, with the force and natural vigour of the body it ſelf, which ought to help him in his obedience to the Spirit, and to render it more fit and prompt to the outward actions of piety and vertue. He pretends that no mortifie ſenſuality, and to weaken the body being one and the ſame thing, according to him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24700"/> he that eats exceſſively in <hi>Lent,</hi> by that means deſtroying his health, and weakning the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrength of his body, correſponds perfectly well with the intention of the Church when it commands us to faſt.</p>
                        <p>That is to ſay, that the true way of purſuing the intent of the Church in <hi>Lent,</hi> is to drink and eat exceſſively, and that the beſt invention to obtain the end of <pb n="367" facs="tcp:46318:200"/>Faſting is not to faſt at all, but rather to give ones ſelf unto debauches, becauſe debauches do more ſubdue the body than Faſting, and they weaken its force, which is the end of Faſting, according to this great Divine.</p>
                        <p>As for the Collation at night, <hi>Bauny</hi> in his Sum, Chap. 16. pag. 255. tells us that we may without breaking our Faſt, take any broth made with herbs, or any Sallet with a red Herring. And to clear it up yet more largely, he demands; And <hi>if a man ſhould take ſome Confection of Almonds or Pottage with coorſe-grated bread, were it a ſin?</hi> He acknowledgeth with ſome others whom he quotes, that this cannot be done without ſin; but he declares his opinion in theſe terms, pag. 255. <hi>But I believe nevertheleſs that by the uſe of theſe things the Faſt is not at all concerned, when they exceed not the quantity which is allowed by the cuſtom of the Church, received by the conſent of prudent perſons.</hi> And that there may be nothing wanting to this reformed Collation, he adds that in the time of this Collation <hi>drinking concerns not the Faſt:</hi> that is to ſay, that we may take as much thereof as we will without breaking our Faſt.</p>

                           <hi>Bauny</hi> who takes many things commonly out of
<hi>Layman,</hi> follows him alſo in this point, ſaying in his Sum, Chap.
16. pag. 258. <hi>He who, after he hath drunk to quench his thirſt, eats a little bread, or who during the day ſhall hold in his mouth ſome Confection, doth he ſin?</hi> He would ſhelter himſelf under ſome Authors whom he cites, ſaying, <hi>That they anſwer boldly, No, in as much as thoſe things ſupply the place of medicine rather than food.</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24780"/> He approves this anſwer, without producing any other, teſtifying that he is indeed neither leſs bold, nor leſs complacent than theſe Authors, though he make ſhew of being more reſerved, making uſe of their names to declare his own opinion in a point, which he believed might be ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; becauſe the looſneſs thereof appeared too viſible.</p>
                        <p>He would notwithſtanding in this great facility, which is as it were natural unto him, appear ſometimes ſevere. For in the ſame Chapter amongſt the things about which he would have a Confeſſor examine his Penitent about the matter of Faſting, he places this for the ſeventh:
<hi>Whether during the whole day he have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any crum of bread never ſo ſmall. For in this, though there be no fault when it is done out of neceſſity; yet he cannot be excuſed from venial ſin, who herein hath no other Rule but his concupiſcence, which is ſo much more blameable, the oftner he bath taken the boldneſs to return thereto, and to take the ſame quantity at many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, though it be little in it ſelf. For though every one of them, conſidered ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly, nouriſh not much, yet they do it, being joyned altogether; beſides ſtrengthning the body, they remove the difficulty of Faſting; and ſo deprive it of the end for which
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46318:202"/>God and the Church inſtituted and ordained it to be done, which is to curb the fleſh as with a bridle, and to bring the appetite into ſubjection unto reaſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It ſeems that this is a great ſeverity for him to condemn this man of venial fin, but he ſweetens it preſently, and corrects himſelf in the ſame page where he makes this queſtion. <hi>And he who without hunger or thirſt ſhall take on a Faſting-day at the requeſt of a friend, ſome wine with a little morſel of bread and ſome few Comfits,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24790"/> ſins he?</hi> He names many Authors who blame this action as contrary to Faſting; but he forbears not to conclude with others who exempt it from ſin, even from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, whereof he relates this reaſon:
<hi>For that,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to act well and prudently is no offence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is without doubt a rare prudence to prefer our being complacent to a friend, before the Laws of God and of the Church, and humane Courteſie before Chriſtian Diſcipline. There is reaſon to call this
<hi>wiſdom of the world,</hi> and even to doubt <hi>if there be any wiſdom in the world like this:</hi> For the people of the world would not have had the confidence to have violated the Laws of the Church at this time and at others more important, if others more wiſe than they in this worldly wiſdom did not furniſh them with reaſons, and give them Expedients to confirm, or rather to deceive their conſciences, in committing theſe exceſſes.</p>

                        <p>It is true in general, that drink nouriſheth accidentally, becauſe there are drinks that nouriſh, and others which nouriſh not at all. But this is not by accident that wine nouriſheth; it hath a force and natural vertue to nouriſh; and there is no wine that nouriſheth not, more or leſs, according as it hath more or leſs ſtrength.

                           <hi>That it is very certain that thoſe who are notably ſick, are exempt from Faſting, though they have fallen into this ſickneſs by their own proper fault,</hi> he adds, <hi>that the ſame muſt be ſaid of a ſick perſon unto whoſe health Faſting might happily conduce. For being otherwiſe truly weak, he is exempt from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to faſt, though by accident Faſting might be beneficial unto him.

                        <p>He ſpeaks of a man who is fallen into a diſeaſe by his own fault, for example, intemperance, for the expiation whereof he is obliged to faſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24860"/> according to the Rules of Penance. He ſuppoſes alſo that Faſting is a remedy for his diſeaſe, and profitable to his health. So that in not faſting he ſins againſt the Laws of the Church, of temperance and of charity which he owes to himſelf, hurting his health already impaired, and augmenting his diſeaſe. And for all that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that becauſe he is ſick he is diſpenſed with for Faſting. That is to ſay, that the ſame diſeaſe which obligeth him to faſt, diſpenſeth with him for it; and the Church which diſpenſeth with none but for to relieve their weakneſs, agrees to this diſpenſation, which relieves not, but hurts him, and pretends not to oblige him unto a Faſt, which, if it commanded him not, he could not omit without ſin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſame muſt be ſaid of him,</hi> adds the ſame Author, <hi>who cannot ſleep in the night of a conſiderable time, unleſs he ſup. For he would be over-charged too much by faſting in this manner. I would not oblige him neither to ſo much as to make his Collation in the morning, in which caſe the Faſt would continue without intermiſſion, though he might do it conveniently; for no man is bound to do extraordinary things that he may faſt, and to abandon the right which he hath to eat about Noon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Indulgence of the Church in ſuffering and permitting to eat at Noon on Faſting-days is a right, according to this Caſuiſt, which its Children may make uſe of againſt it to the neglect of its Commandment. He finds not that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb n="373" facs="tcp:46318:203"/>to do any thing extraordinary, nor to the leaſt change in the order or hour of our repaſt to keep the Faſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24870"/> and obey the Church. And in another place he finds it very reaſonable that to content a friend, for his own benefit, pleaſure, or any the leaſt reaſon in the world, and even without reaſon, we ſhould alter the uſual courſe of our repaſt, and advance the time two or three hours or more, if we will.</p>

<hi>is that this Precept is fulfilled by a voluntary receiving of the Sacrament, in what ſort ſoever, even ſacrilegiouſly, becauſe the ſubſtance of the act only is commanded; and the manner not at all, according to Suarez.</hi> Could the Church expreſs better the manner wherein it would have us communicate, than by joyning the Command of Confeſſion and Penance to that of the Communion, and ordaining that we ſhould receive this Sacrament with reverence, <hi>reverenter?</hi> And to the end we might not miſtake this Reverence for any external Ceremony, it allows none to communicate at <hi>Eaſter</hi> whom their Confeſſors judge not fit, that afterwards it might be performed with the greater preparation and reſpect.

                     <p>As for what concerns the preparation unto the Communion, as the Jeſuits make the Command to communicate altogether outward and politick, and maintain that we may accompliſh it in any ſtate of ſin wherein we are, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25070"/> and even by a ſin and ſacrilegious manducation; it is no wonder if they ſcarcely ever ſpeak of internal diſpoſitions required to a worthy participation; and content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with thoſe only which are external: And alſo they ſpeak of them ſo ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo unworthily as is ſad to conſider, and gives cauſe of aſtoniſhment and indignation to thoſe who have any knowledge of the Grandeur and Holineſs of this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe they hold Confeſſion to be a principal preparation to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it ſeems they believed that it was not reaſonable to require it to be done in any better manner than the Communion.

                        <hi>that the Precept of Confeſſion being impoſed as a penalty, we muſt not extend it ſo far as to ſay, that it obliges to make ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as may reſtore the ſinner into a ſtate of Grace: but we muſt rather reſtrain it, ſaying, that it is enough to make one that doth not confer any Grace on him, provided it be a true one, and have every thing elſe that is of the Eſſence of a Sacrament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is not to honour the Sacraments very much, to pretend that they are not Gods gifts and graces, but penalties: and that when Jeſus Chriſt commanded Confeſſion, he ordained it not for our good, as a remedy and a means to deliver us from our ſins, and to reſtore us into Grace; but that he impoſed it upon us as a yoke and a puniſhment, as this Jeſuit ſaith. <hi>Cum igitur praeceptum confeſſionis ſit poenale.</hi>

                     <p>He that ſhould ſay that a remedy ordained by a Phyſitian to a Patient were a puniſhment, and not a relief and a favour; or when a Prince ordains that a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor ſhall confeſs the crimes whereof he deſires the abolition, that he uſes him rigorouſly, and impoſes an odious Law upon him, would paſs for a man of little diſcretion and without common ſenſe. The Malefactors hold this for a favour in ſuch ſort, that they ordinarily ſet down their crimes in the Letters of Grace which are given them, in the moſt effectual and odious terms they can, and are for the moſt part ready to ſay therein more than they have done, rather than leſs, to heighten the favour of the Prince, to render it more ample, and the better to aſſure themſelves of it, though this Declaration be publick and in writing. And yet <hi>Amicus</hi> dares ſay that the Confeſſion which God and the Church demand of a ſinner, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25100"/> that he may obtain remiſſion of his ſins, which is ſecret, and by word of mouth only, is rather a penalty than a grace and favour. <hi>Praeceptum confeſſionis eſt poenale.</hi>

                     <p>Which ſhews that the Jeſuits know not the eſtate of the Church, nor its mind, nor its conduct; conſidering it as an humane and ſecular Society, which regards only what is outward; ſince it hath no other ſcope than civil peace and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral happineſs; or as the Synagogue of the Jews which adhered only to the letter and outward exerciſes of Religion and Gods Law. Though we cannot find in the very times of the Synagogue it ſelf any Jews who have affirmed that the Law might be fulfilled by Sacriledges, and manifeſt and voluntary impieties, as the Jeſuits, who ſay that we may ſatisfie the Commandments of communicating, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25120"/> confeſſing, hearing Maſs, and ſuch like, by doing them with contempt, and all ſorts of unſufferable irreverences and profanations.

                     <p>That is to ſay, that we may eat before we communicate, provided we eat not much; all one as in Faſting days commanded by the Church, we may according to theſe Dictors, take a morſel of bread, and drink once without breaking our <pb n="384" facs="tcp:46318:209"/>Faſt. But if there be any fault in communicating thus, the moſt rigorous can make it but a venial one.</p>
                     <p>So the Jeſuits acknowledging hardly any, ſave theſe two diſpoſitions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations neceſſary to communicate, that is, Confeſſion and Faſting, yet are found in truth to deſtroy them both,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25160"/> and to give liberty to people to communicate without having any at all. And indeed if it be true, as theſe Jeſuits teach, that by communicating in an eſtate of mortal ſin, and knowing well that we commit Sacriledge, we ceaſe not to ſatisfie the Precept of the Communion, any thing is credible after this in this matter: and it ſeems that, according to this opinion, we need no other preparation to approach the Altar and holy Table, than for to eat at our common tables, and that a man may go with the ſame pace and temper to receive the Communion as he would to a Feaſt to be debauched.</p>

And after he adds,

                        <hi>That this Cuſtom is inſtead of a Law, and hath a vertue to oblige upon pain of mortal ſin; as may be collected from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges that the Popes give unto Monks to ſay Maſs before day and after noon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He would ſay, that if it were only a venial ſin to ſay Maſs before day or after noon, there would be no need to demand a Diſpenſation, for neither he nor his Companions make any great account of venial ſins, mortal ones only in their opinion requiring a Diſpenſation, that they may be committed without fear or danger. So that all Laws and Commandments that oblige not under mortal ſin, have not any need of a Diſpenſation, according to theſe Doctors, and we may boldly violate and contemn them.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen hitherto in divers places of this Book, and particularly in this Treatiſe of the Commandments of the Church, that, according to the Jeſuits, when the Church commands the Faithful to pray, to aſſiſt at divine Service, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25180"/> to ſay, to hear Maſs on the Feaſt and Lords-days, to communicate at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs at leaſt once a year; we may ſatisfie and accompliſh all its Commands by doing only the outward actions which it commandeth, though we do them by compulſion, in hypocriſie, with a formal deſign not to obey it, through any wicked motive, and by committing in the very outward action of the obedience we render it, crimes and Sacriledges. It is now pertinent for us, and as it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the proſecution of this Work, to diſcover the cauſe of this miſchief, and to aſcend unto the Spring and Principle from whence the Jeſuits draw theſe Maxims ſo pernicious and contrary to all good Manners, Chriſtian Purity, Sanctity of the Sacraments, Authority and Conduct of the Church and of the Holy Ghoſt who animates and governs it in all things. This we are about to do in the next Chapter, where we ſhall ſhew that the Jeſuits hold, that the Church is no other than an humane Aſſembly and a Body Politick; and by conſequence that it hath no Power nor Authority over internal and ſpiritual actions, which are out of its Juriſdiction; becauſe they are hid and without its cognizance. Whence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that when it commands any practice of Vertue, exerciſe of Religion, or uſe <pb n="385" facs="tcp:46318:209"/>of the Sacraments, its Commandment reaches only to, and ſtays at what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in theſe actions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25190"/> without proceeding farther unto inward actions, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges not to any other thing than to do ſimply what it ordaineth in ſome ſort whatever it be, and upon what deſign or motive ſoever it be done; that we may repreſent the Opinions the Jeſuits have of the Church, its Authority, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, we will add this Article to the three former.</p>

                     <head>ARTICLE IV. <hi>That the Jeſuits teach that the Church cannot command ſpiritual and internal Actions; that its Laws and Guidance are humane; that it is it ſelf only a Politick Body.</hi>

                     <p>IF you inquire of the Jeſuits wherefore, according to their Divinity, we may be diſcharged of the Prayers ordained by the Church by praying with volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtraction, and reciting the divine Service without intention? Wherefore we may accompliſh the Command of ſaying Maſs on Feaſt and Lords-days, by attending without devotion; that of Faſting, by faſting for vain-glory; that of Confeſſion, by confeſſing without ſufficient ſorrow for ſin; that of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> by receiving with hypocriſie, and knowing we are in mortal ſin? Wherefore we may acquit our ſelves of Penance injoyned us by a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; accompliſh a Vow made unto God; ſatisfie a Promiſe, an Oath made unto men and God; by doing only in outward appearance what we are obliged to do? And why we may generally accompliſh all ſorts of Precepts by actions which in truth are ſins, by doing them without any deſign to diſcharge our duty, and on the contrary with a formal deſign not to diſcharge it, and by a formal contempt of the Commandment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25200"/> and thoſe who made it, having an expreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention not to obey even then when we ſeem to obey it, doing outwardly what is commanded.</p>

                     <p>The laſt of theſe anſwers is moſt general. And indeed the other two depend on it, and are referred unto it as Concluſions unto their Principle. For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherefore, according to them, the Church cannot preſcribe the manner of doing things which it commands, nor the end wherefore they ought to be done, is becauſe the end and good motion for which they ought to be done, that they might be well done, are acts of the will and internal power, upon which they pretend that the Church hath neither power nor command: <hi>Eccleſia actus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos non poteſt praecipere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that being here to declare the Principles of all the miſchievous Maxims which we have reported before, which tend to the ruine and entire abolition of <pb n="386" facs="tcp:46318:210"/>the Commands of God and the Church and all Chriſtian Piety, I will only ſtand upon the Examination of this:
<hi>That the Church cannot abſolutely command or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid internal acts;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſia non poteſt abſolute praecipete actus internos.</note> becauſe this comprehends all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>To make appear that this Principle is common amongſt the Jeſuits, we ſhall not need freſh proof. For beſides that they make no difficulty to confeſs it, I have already before in divers places reported many paſſages wherein they uſe it to elude the Commandments of God and the Church, and teach men to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value and deſpiſe them. And to refute this ſo pernicious Doctrine, it will ſuffice to have repreſented, as I have done, the wicked ſequels which infallibly ariſe from it, and the conſequences contrary unto the Foundations of Religion and Chriſtian Piety which depend thereon, and are inſeparable from it.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe that this point is very important,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25220"/> and hath a great extent in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion and good Manners, I will here relate ſome more paſſages upon this ſubject, to make it yet more clear, and make the pernicious ſequels of this novel Doctrine of the Jeſuits evidently appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Layman</hi> ſpeaking of this matter, gives a charitable advice, or rather a Law to the Paſtors and Biſhops of the Church, ſaying,

                     </p>
                     <p>He puts no difference betwixt Secular Law-givers and Paſtors of the Church, nor betwixt Authority of thoſe, and the Ordinances of theſe. He denies equally to both a Power of regulating what is internal of their Subjects, and to preſcribe unto them the intention and other ſpiritual diſpoſitions in which they ought to do what they command them. He excepts not the Superiors in Religious Orders, unto whom yet he gives in this point more power than unto the Biſhops and the Pope himſelf:
<note n="2" place="margin">Praelatis tamen regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus paulo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor poteſtas in ſuos competit, ratione voti re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioſi obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Praelato in omnibus, quae ſecund um regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam &amp; conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudinem Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis praecipiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

                        <hi>The Prelates Regulars,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have a little more power over their Inferiors, becauſe of the Religious vow they have made to obey their Superior in all that he ſhall command them according to the Rule and Cuſtoms of their Order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He grounds this pretended advantage of the Superiors of the Religious Orders above the Paſtors of the Church, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25230"/> upon the vow which the Religious make to obey them in all things; as if the Faithful were not obliged by Baptiſm to render all manner of obedience to the Church as well as thoſe who enter into any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Order promiſe to keep the Rule, and to obey thoſe who received them into it; and as if a Religious perſon could give more power over himſelf to his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior than Jeſus Chriſt hath given his Church, and its Paſtors over the Chriſtians whom he hath committed to their Governance.</p>
                     <p>But he grounds himſelf alſo upon the Authority of
<hi>Suarez,
<note n="3" place="margin">Qua de re Suarez lib. 4. de legibus cap. 12. in fine, ubi monet diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eſſe inter obligationem regularium ex voto obedientiae &amp; obligationem aliorum ex lege civili vel Eccleſiaſtica Nam lex fundatur in juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictione quae ſolum data eſt quantum expedit ad bonum communitatis.

<hi>Ibid.</hi>
                           </note> Who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>treating on this ſubject, obſerves that there is difference betwixt the obligation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons by vertue of their vow of obedience, and that of others by vertue of Civil and Eccleſiaſtick Law. For the Law is founded upon Juriſdiction and Authority, which is not given the Law-giver but for the common good. But the command of a Superior in a Religious Order is founded upon the will of him who makes the vow, and upon the covenant and promiſe by which he is obliged to obey. And this promiſe being principally made to God who hath power over the internal acts, it may be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe acts as well as the external.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this arguing be good for the Superiors of Religious Orders, it muſt needs be good alſo for the Superiors of the Church. For we ſubmit our ſelves voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Superiors of the Church, as the other ſubmit voluntarily to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors in a Religious Order. We become Chriſtians voluntarily, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25240"/> as we become Religious voluntarily: and as we promiſe obedience to the Superiors of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Order in becoming a Monk; ſo we promiſe obedience to the Superiors of the Church in becoming Chriſtians; and we promiſe to render them this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as to them who hold the place of God, according to the Word of Jeſus <pb n="387" facs="tcp:46318:210"/>Chriſt:

20.</note> Gods ſpeaks unto you by us; we are but the Miniſters and Embaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If then the Superiors of a Religious Order can command the internal actions; becauſe the ſubmiſſion rendred unto them depends on the will and promiſe of their Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors which regards God in them it muſt alſo be confeſſed by the ſame reaſon, that the Eccleſiaſtick Superiors &amp; Prelates have the ſame power, and may as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the internal actions of them that are ſubject unto them for their Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it is incredible, and contrary to the moſt common apprehenſions of Chriſtianity; that the Superiors of Religious Orders ſhould have more Power and Authority in their Congregations, than the Biſhops and Pope himſelf have in the Church, and that the Power of the Pope and the Biſhops ſhould not be more internal and ſpiritual, than that of Magiſtrates and Secular Princes, unto whom theſe Jeſuits compare them, ſetting them all equally in the ſame inability to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand internal things, without acknowledging any difference betwixt them in this point, and giving this advantage above them only unto Superiors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25250"/> when they ſay,

                     <p>Alſo they pretend to hold it from the will of thoſe who make vows of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſince they ſay,

                        <hi>That the command of a Superior in a Religious Order is founded upon the will of him who makes the vow, and on the covenant and promiſe by which he is obliged to obey him, &amp;c.</hi> They would then that the Superiors of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Order receive not from the Church the Authority and Power which they have to command; but from the will of thoſe who become Religious; and they are herein ſoveraign and independent on the Church. Which is both againſt the modeſty of Religious perſons, the Order of the Church, truth it ſelf, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſon, the Superiors of the Religious Orders being not capable of ſo much only as to receive any Religious into their Order, but by the power which they have received from the Superiors of the Church, who conſequently have all the power of the Superiors of the Religious Orders, and much more; but they have it in a manner more eminent, as the Spring and Principle of this Power.</p>
                     <p>And if the Inferiors can by their will and by their vows give to the Superiors of Religious Orders Authority and Power to command them even internal things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25260"/> Jeſus Chriſt might, with ſtronger reaſon, give it unto the Prelates of the Church over them and over all other the Faithful; ſince Jeſus Chriſt hath more power over us, than we have over our ſelves, and we are, without compariſon, more his than our own.</p>
                     <p>So that he might give the Church all power over us, which private perſons can give over themſelves to Superiors of Religious Orders by their vows, and much more.</p>
                     <p>Which ſhews that the Eccleſiaſtick is far different from the Civil Juriſdiction, with which the Jeſuits nevertheleſs do confound it; and the Eccleſiaſtick are other than the Civil Laws, which they notwithſtanding would make equal. For the Juriſdiction which Jeſus Chriſt hath given the Church over all Chriſtians, is more extended, holy, and divine than that of Secular Magiſtrates, and it reſpects Souls more than bodies, the inward than the outward; ſince it reſpects eternal Salvation, which depends altogether on the actions of the Soul, and not of the body, which do nothing without thoſe of the Soul.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Jeſus Chriſt hath not given unto Secular Powers the Holy Ghoſt to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their people, as he hath given it to his Church. He hath not given them the power to open and ſhut Heaven unto them; to cut them off and re-unite them to his body; to nouriſh them with his fleſh and blood, and to fill them with his Spirit, and he hath not ſaid unto them that when they ſpeak, it is the Holy Ghoſt who ſpeaks in them; that it is the Holy Ghoſt who commands what they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; that whoſo deſpiſe and diſhonour them, deſpiſe and diſhonour the Holy <pb n="388" facs="tcp:46318:211"/>Ghoſt. For thus the Apoſtles have ſpoken in the Scripture,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25270"/> ſince S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ananias</hi> and his Wife, that they lyed unto the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they had lyed unto one of the Miniſters of the Church. And this is the reaſon that the Councils and the Fathers ſo often call the Laws of the Church Sacred and Divine, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they proceed from the Holy Ghoſt, who is always in the Church as Jeſus Chriſt was with the Apoſtles, and conducted them till his Paſſion and death.</p>
                     <p>Which is ſo true, that <hi>Layman</hi> himſelf could not refrain from acknowledging it more than once, in very clear terms,
<note n="1" place="margin">Quis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim neget quin lege vel praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pto Eccleſiae, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pote animarum ſalutem ſptctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, praecipi poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit ut miniſtri Eccleſiae vere &amp; non ſimulatorie orent, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrent Fidelibus omnibus, ut Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenta vere &amp; non per ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ſuſcipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant?

                     <p>For the Civil Power regards the outward order and civil tranquillity alone, and preſcribes none but outward and humane means to attain this end. But the Church being eſtabliſhed for procuring unto men eternal life, inward and divine peace, it ought to have power to ordain means, and to give commands propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to that end, whereunto we cannot attain but by actions of the Soul alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſpiritual and divine.

                     <p>Finally, it will appear by theſe exceſſes which would ſeem to us incredible, if our eyes did not oblige us to believe in ſeeing and reading them in the Books of the Jeſuits, that theſe men deſtroy the Church from its Foundation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25390"/> and make it altogether external, humane, and politick. And this is that <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſaith in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, calling it a Body politick, <hi>Corpus politicum.</hi> After this we cannot think it ſtrange, if other Jeſuits, in conformity to the Opinions, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the common Doctrines of the Society, have ſaid that there need only politick vertues to govern the Church, and to exerciſe its principal Offices, which are Government and Policy, and that its Laws are but humane and politick, which oblige only to the external part of its Commands, not only in thoſe made by the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, but by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who according to theſe Doctors, hath commanded nothing but in an humane manner, as other Princes do.</p>
                     <p>So that whereas Jeſus Chriſt hath called his Kingdom not of this world, the Jeſuits maintain that it is, and like to that of the Princes of the Earth. And whereas he hath ſaid that his Kingdom is within us and in the innermoſt parts of our Souls, they maintain on the contrary, that it is external and without us, and that the Church, which is his Kingdom, is no other than a politick Body and Church. And ſo by the wonderful Judgment of God they fall into the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath pronounced ſo many Ages ago againſt the Novatian Hereticks who introduced an humane Church. <hi>Eccleſiam humanam faciunt.</hi> And in this they make themſelves like the Libertines of our times, who reduce all Religion into Policy, and deſerve as well as they to bear the name of Politicks,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25400"/> which they would injuriouſly and falſly attribute unto the Church and its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, by repreſenting and rendring as much as they can both their Authority and Government altogether humane and politick.</p>
